            COMMIT: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

            The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

            ## Step 1: Get the diff and categorize
            Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see all changes.
            Categorize files into: DOCS (.mdx, .md), CODE (.js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx), CI (.yml in .github/), CONFIG (other).

            ## Step 2: Review based on file type

            ### For DOCS files (.mdx, .md):
            Read CONTRIBUTING.md first - it contains our style guide. Then check:
            - [ ] Links use relative file paths with .mdx extension (not URL paths)
            - [ ] YAML code blocks have correct indentation
            - [ ] Admonitions (:::note, :::warning) are not inside JSX components like <Step>
            - [ ] Sentence case for headings (not Title Case)
            - [ ] Present tense, active voice
            - [ ] No "easy", "simple", "obvious" words
            - [ ] vCluster trademark used correctly (never "vClusters")

            ### For CODE/CI files (.js, .ts, .yml):
            - [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
            - [ ] Syntax is valid
            - [ ] Logic errors or bugs
            - [ ] Security issues

            ### For vCluster YAML configs:
            Use mcp__vcluster-yaml__validate-config to validate.
            Use mcp__vcluster-yaml__smart-query to verify options exist.

            ## Step 3: Post findings

            You MUST post a PR comment using `gh pr comment` with this EXACT structure:

            ```
            ## Review for COMMIT_SHA

            **Files reviewed:** X files (list them)

            ### Findings

            [For each issue, explain: FILE:LINE - what's wrong and how to fix it]
            [If no issues: explain what you verified in each file]

            ### Checklist verified
            - [x] or [ ] for each item you checked above
            ```

            IMPORTANT: Do NOT just say "looks good" or "no issues found" without listing what you actually checked.
            A review with no details is UNACCEPTABLE. Show your work.

            ## Step 4: Update PR description
            Add summary between markers <!-- CLAUDE_SUMMARY --> and <!-- /CLAUDE_SUMMARY -->:
            ```
            > [!NOTE]
            > One-line summary of PR changes.
            >
            > - **Area**: specific change
            >
            > <sup>Generated by Claude for COMMIT_SHA</sup>
            ```
