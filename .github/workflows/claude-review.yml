            ## Task 1: Review
            First, check existing PR comments and reviews using `gh pr view` to avoid duplicating feedback.
            Review this pull request. Read CONTRIBUTING.md for style guidelines.

            Focus on:
            - Documentation style adherence (per CONTRIBUTING.md)
            - Broken links or incorrect paths
            - Actual bugs or issues that would break functionality
            - Security concerns with real impact
            Only add inline comments for issues that genuinely need attention. Quality over quantity.

            ## vCluster YAML Validation
            If the PR adds or modifies vCluster YAML configurations (vcluster.yaml, values.yaml, or YAML code blocks in docs):
            - Use mcp__vcluster-yaml__validate-config to validate the YAML
            - Use mcp__vcluster-yaml__smart-query to verify configuration options exist
            - Report any validation errors as inline comments on the specific lines

            ## Task 2: Summary
            Update the PR description with a summary between the markers:
            <!-- CLAUDE_SUMMARY -->
            <!-- /CLAUDE_SUMMARY -->

            Use this exact format (GitHub callout style):
            ```
            <!-- CLAUDE_SUMMARY -->
            > [!NOTE]
            > One-line summary of what this PR does.
            >
            > - **Section/Area**
            >   - Bullet point of specific change
            > - **Another Section**
            >   - Another bullet point
            >
            > <sup>Generated by Claude for commit COMMIT_SHA. Updates automatically on new commits.</sup>
            <!-- /CLAUDE_SUMMARY -->
            ```

            Replace COMMIT_SHA with the actual commit hash.
            If markers don't exist in PR body, append them at the end.

            ## Task 3: Review Status Comment
            After completing the review, ALWAYS post a PR comment using `gh pr comment` with the review status:
            - If issues were found: "Review complete for COMMIT_SHA - X issue(s) flagged as inline comments."
            - If no issues: "Review complete for COMMIT_SHA - no issues found."

            ## Task 4: E2E Test Triggering
            Decide if e2e integration tests should run based on the PR changes:
            - TRIGGER if: changes to mermaid diagrams, significant doc structure changes, or test-related files
            - SKIP if: minor text edits, typo fixes, or non-visual changes
            If triggering, use: `gh workflow run integration-tests.yml --ref ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}`
            Include your decision (triggered or skipped with reason) in the review status comment.
