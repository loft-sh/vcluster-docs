The `vcluster.yaml` file contains all configuration options when deploying, making changes or upgrading a virtual cluster. It's an optional file passed to any deployment method, and without this file, a virtual cluster is created with a set of default values.

Example configuration options include the vCluster control plane's [backing store](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/), resource syncing behavior [from](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/) and [to](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/) the host cluster, and exporting the virtual cluster's [kubeconfig](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/export-kube-config) file. Benefits of this file include:

- **Unified Configuration:** All settings for vCluster in one place, simplifying management.
- **Schema Validation:** Automatically validate the configuration when using the vCluster CLI.
- **IDE Support:** Integrated schema with popular IDEs for autocompletion and validation.

#### Example `vcluster.yaml` file

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore: # This backing store option is a Pro feature and requires a license. Remove it if you don't have a license.
    etcd:
      embedded: 
        enabled: true
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    host: vcluster-k8s-api.example.com
sync:
  toHost:
    serviceAccounts:
      enabled: true
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      clearImageStatus: true
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-vcluster-context
  server: https://vcluster-k8s-api.example.com
  secret:
    name: my-vcluster-kubeconfig
```

This example configuration defines:
1. [Embedded etcd](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/embedded) as the vCluster control plane's backing store to reduce management overhead (Pro feature).
1. Syncing [ServiceAccount](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/advanced/service-accounts) resources from the virtual to the host cluster, to support.
1. Deploying an [Ingress](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/deployment/ingress) resource on the host cluster to expose the vCluster control plane's API server as a hostname.
1. Syncing real [node](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes) data, rather than the default "pseudo" nodes, but clears the `ImageStatuses` field within the `NodeStatus` of the synced nodes.
1. How to export the [kubeconfig](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/export-kube-config) file to a secret, so you can use it, for example, in your ArgoCD or Terraform pipelines.

## How to Use `vcluster.yaml`
### Creating a New Virtual Cluster
- Define your configuration options in the `vcluster.yaml` file.
- Deploy your virtual cluster.

### Updating Existing Virtual Clusters
- Update your `vcluster.yaml` file with any new configuration options.
- Apply the updates.

## FAQs

### How do I upgrade my 0.19.x and earlier virtual cluster configurations?

If you have existing 0.19.x virtual clusters, you can convert the old configuration values to the new v0.20 format. [View the guide](/vcluster/reference/migrations/0-20-migration) for more details.

### Is it required to provide a `vcluster.yaml` file?
No, if a `vcluster.yaml` file isn't provided, the vCluster will be created using a set of default values.

### Can I change the configuration for existing virtual clusters?
Yes, you can run `vcluster create VCLUSTER_NAME --upgrade -f vcluster.yaml`
