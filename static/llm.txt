# vCluster

> vCluster is an open-source project by LoftLabs that creates lightweight, fully functional Kubernetes clusters that run inside namespaces of other Kubernetes clusters.

Virtual clusters are certified Kubernetes distributions that run as isolated, virtual environments nested inside a physical host cluster. They improve isolation and flexibility for multi-tenancy by allowing multiple teams to operate independently on the same infrastructure, minimizing conflicts, increasing autonomy, and reducing costs.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install vCluster CLI
curl -L -o vcluster "https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases/latest/download/vcluster-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"
sudo install -c -m 0755 vcluster /usr/local/bin

# Create a virtual cluster
vcluster create my-vcluster

# Connect to the virtual cluster
vcluster connect my-vcluster

# Use kubectl with the virtual cluster
kubectl get namespaces
```

## Architecture Overview

vCluster consists of:
- **Control Plane**: Runs inside a StatefulSet/Deployment in the host cluster
- **API Server**: Kubernetes API (k3s/k8s/k0s) serving the virtual cluster
- **Data Store**: SQLite (default), etcd, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
- **Syncer**: Synchronizes resources between virtual and host clusters
- **Scheduler**: Optional virtual scheduler or reuses host scheduler
