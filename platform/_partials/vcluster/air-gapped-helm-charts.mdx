The platform uses Helm to manage virtual clusters. If your cluster is running in an air-gapped environment, you may host
Helm charts in an OCI compatible private registry. To use a private registry for virtual clusters there are several
configuration options:
- Configure the platform for [offline Helm charts](../../../install/advanced/air-gapped#offline-helm-charts)
- Configure the Helm chart repository and authentication for each [virtual cluster](../../../../api/resources/virtualclusterinstance).
- Configure the Helm chart repository and authentication using [virtual cluster templates](../../../../api/resources/virtualclustertemplate).
