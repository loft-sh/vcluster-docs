  <Step>
    The <Label>Definition</Label> tab contains settings relating to the virtual
    cluster deployment itself, here you can provide Helm values to be used when
    deploying the virtual cluster, select the virtual cluster distribution (e.g.
    k8s (default), k3s, k0s), as well as configurations for sleep mode and
    ingress access.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <Label>Objects</Label> is where you can define Kubernetes manifests that
    should be created in the virtual cluster.
  </Step>

All configuration options in a vCluster defined in the `vcluster.yaml` can be manually configured when creating any virtual cluster. [Read more](../../../vcluster/vcluster-yaml/) about the `vcluster.yaml` configuration options.
