  All requests that are made through vCluster Platform count as activity in the{" "}
  {props.name}

.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
  kubectl("<code>kubectl get pod my-pod</code>") --> vCluster Platform

  vCluster Platform("<img src='/pro/docs/media/vclusterpro_white.svg' width='160' height='80' />")

  vCluster Platform --> Cluster("Connected Cluster <br/> Kubernetes API Server")
  Cluster --> Pod("<pre>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pod\n...</pre>")

  class kubectl code
  class Pod yaml
  class vCluster Platform loft
```

If your kube-context points to vCluster Platform's API server as a proxy before the actual connected cluster's API server, every `kubectl` request will be an activity and reset the inactivity timeout.

### Ingress Requests

For ingress-nginx based ingresses, activity detection also works automatically. Other ingress controllers are currently not supported. For nginx based ingresses, vCluster Platform will add a special annotation to each ingress that will track activity and reset the timer as soon as a request is made to that ingress.

:::info Ingress Wakeup

<span>
  vCluster Platform supports waking up a {props.name} through an ingress independent
  of the underlying ingress controller. Just navigate to the ingress host and
  you should see a vCluster Platform wakeup page for the {props.name}.
