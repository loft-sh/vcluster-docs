Determine the External-IP address:

```bash title="Get the loft-ingress external IP address"
kubectl get ingress -n vcluster-platform
NAME           CLASS    HOSTS                ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE
loft-ingress   <none>   vcluster-platform.mydomain.tld    x.x.x.x          80, 443   10m
```

:::info Address
If you never get a valid IP Address in the ADDRESS column shown in the command,
you might need to work
with your Kubernetes administrator to ensure your ingress is properly configured.
