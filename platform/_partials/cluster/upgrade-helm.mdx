If you prefer to use Helm, you need to make sure that you have a valid Access Key.
You can get the access key for the cluster by running
```bash
vcluster platform get cluster-access-key cluster-name
```
In this example, the `cluster-name` is the name of the cluster that contains the platform agent to be upgraded.
The expected output would be:
```bash
14:43:35 info vCluster platform host: https://loftg2fei.loft.host
14:43:35 info Access Key: xxxxxxxx
```
The `https://loftg2fei.loft.host` is the `url` and the `xxxxxxxx` is the `token`.

Then, run the following command to include the `url` and `token` to upgrade the platform agent:
```yaml
helm upgrade loft vcluster-platform \
    --repo https://charts.loft.sh \
    --install \
    --create-namespace \
    --namespace vcluster-platform \
    --set agentOnly=true \
    --set url=https://loftg2fei.loft.host \
    --set token=xxxxxxxx
```
