When connecting a cluster from the vCluster CLI, you will need to provide a name for the cluster. This name will be used for the Cluster resource that gets created in Kubernetes. Optionally, you can use the `display-name` flag to specify a name for this cluster, when it gets displayed under the <NavStep>Clusters</NavStep> view in vCluster Platform.

```bash
vcluster platform add cluster cluster-name --display-name [display-name]
```

The above command will automatically install the vCluster Platform Agent in the cluster that is one's current context. 

By default, the namespace `vcluster-platform` will be created if it doesn't exist on the cluster. The vCluster Platform Agent resources will be deployed in `vcluster-platform` namespace. The behavior can be changed by setting `--namespace` explicitly. You can find more CLI flags information at [CLI documentation](/docs/vcluster/cli/vcluster_platform_add_cluster).

If you want to connect a cluster that is not your current context, you can use the `--context` flag to specify the context of the cluster you want to connect.

```bash
vcluster platform add cluster cluster-name --display-name [display-name] --context [context]
```
You can verify that the cluster is connected to the platform by running:
```bash
vcluster platform list clusters
```

and the expected output would be:
```bash
         CLUSTER      |  AGE
  --------------------+--------
    cluster-name      | 7s
```
