You can verify that the platform agent is installed in the cluster by running:
```bash
vcluster platform list clusters
```
The expected output would be:
```bash
         CLUSTER      |  AGE
  --------------------+--------
    cluster-name      |  7s
```
In this example, the host cluster where the platform agent is installed is named `cluster-name`.

By providing the Helm chart version and values configuration, you can install or upgrade the existing platform agent deployment for the cluster-name cluster using::
```
vcluster platform add cluster cluster-name \
     --helm-chart-version v4.5 \
     --helm-values my-helm-values \
     --context cluster-name-context
```
Choose the appropriate version in `--helm-chart-version` and Helm chart configuration in `--helm-values`. Replace `--context` with the Kubernetes context of your target cluster. 
If you are already operating within that cluster’s context, you can omit the --context flag — the command will automatically install or upgrade the platform agent in the current cluster.
You can find more details about the available flags for the `vcluster platform add cluster` command in the [CLI documentation](/docs/vcluster/cli/vcluster_platform_add_cluster).
