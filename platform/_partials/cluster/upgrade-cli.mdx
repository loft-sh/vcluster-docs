You can verify that the platform agent is intsalled in the cluster by running:
```bash
vcluster platform list clusters
```

In this example, the name of the cluster that contains the platform agent is `cluster-name`:
```bash
         CLUSTER      |  AGE
  --------------------+--------
    cluster-name      | 7s
```

By providing the Helm chart path ane the values configuration, you can upgrade the existing platform agent deployment by running:
```
vcluster platform add cluster cluster-name \
     --helm-chart-version v4.5 \
     --helm-values xx \
     --context cluster-name-context
```
