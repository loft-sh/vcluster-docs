This example shows how to create and delete a virtual cluster for testing an application named `my-app` on pull requests.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/vclusters.yaml
name: Pull Request Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "main"
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install vCluster CLI
        uses: loft-sh/setup-vcluster@main
      - name: Login to vCluster Platform instance
        env:
          LOFT_URL: ${{ secrets.LOFT_URL }}
          ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_KEY }}
        run: vcluster login $LOFT_URL --access-key $ACCESS_KEY
      - name: Create PR Virtual Cluster
        env:
          NAME: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
        run: vcluster create $NAME --project default
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
      - name: Wait for Deployment
        run: kubectl rollout status deployments/my-app
      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
      - name: Delete PR Virtual Cluster
        env:
          NAME: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
        run: vcluster delete $NAME --project default
```

**Explanation:**

1. The [Setup vCluster Platform](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-vcluster) action is used to install the vCluster CLI.
2. The `vcluster login` command is used to log in to the organization's vCluster Platform instance. Environment variables `LOFT_URL` and `ACCESS_KEY` are populated using [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions). See [Access Keys](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/administer/users-permissions/access-keys) for help generating a vCluster Platform access key.
3. The `vcluster create` command is used to create a unique virtual cluster using information about the pull request in the `default` project. This will automatically configure the kube context for the next steps.
4. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
5. Before running tests, we use `kubectl` to wait for the `my-app` deployment to become ready.
6. Now we run the end-to-end tests. In this example we're using `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework.
7. Finally, the `vcluster delete` command is used to delete the virtual cluster.
