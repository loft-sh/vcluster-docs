This guide explains how to integrate GitLab Single Sign-On (SSO) with the platform, allowing users to authenticate using their GitLab credentials.

<Flow id="sso-gitlab">
<Step>

**Create A GitLab App**

Navigate to the [GitLab User Settings > Applications](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications) page and create a new application with the following settings:

- Application name: Platform Login via GitLab
- Redirect URI: https://vcluster-platform.yourcompany.tld/auth/gitlab/callback = `https:// + $VCLUSTER_PRO_HOSTNAME + /auth/gitlab/callback`
- Scopes: `read_user` + `openid`

:::info
GitLab generates a `$GITLAB_CLIENT_ID` and `$GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET` for your OAuth application. These credentials are required for the next step.

</Step>
<Step>

**Create Platform config For GitLab**

To set up GitLab SSO in the platform:

- Access the platform's administrative interface.
- Navigate to the `Admin > Config` section.
- Modify your configuration as shown in the example below:

```yaml title="GitLab SSO configuration"
auth:
  # Tell loft to use gitlab authentication
  gitlab:
    #
    #
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # ClientID for the gitlab authentication. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $GITLAB_CLIENT_ID
    # ClientSecret for the gitlab authentication. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/gitlab/callback
    redirectURI: https://vcluster-platform.my.domain/auth/gitlab/callback
    #
    #
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) BaseURL of the gitlab instance,
    # default = https://gitlab.com
    baseURL: https://my-gitlab-instance.com
    # (Optional) Optional groups whitelist, communicated through the "groups" scope.
    # If groups is omitted, all of the user's GitLab groups are returned.
    # If groups is provided, this acts as a whitelist - only the user's GitLab
    # groups that are in the configured groups below will go into the groups claim.
    # Conversely, if the user is not in any of the configured groups, the user will
    # not be authenticated.
    groups:
      - my-group
```

</Step>
<Step>

**Authenticate via GitLab**

After saving the new configuration, the platform should restart automatically. Users can now log in using their GitLab credentials.
