**Create platform config for Microsoft**

The platform is able to use Microsoft Single Sign-On (SSO) OAuth2 flow to
identify the end user through their Microsoft account.

The groups claim is only supported when tenant is specified in Microsoft connector
config. Furthermore, tenant must also be configured to either `<tenant uuid> or

For the platform to list groups on behalf of the logged-in user, explicit organization administrator consent is required. To obtain consent:

- When registering the platform application on https://apps.dev.microsoft.com, add an explicit Directory.Read.All permission to the list of Delegated Permissions.
- Open the following link in your browser and log in under an organization administrator account:

`https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/adminconsent?client_id=<client id>`

To configure the platform to use Microsoft for SSO, navigate to `Admin > Config` in the platform and adjust your config as shown below:

```yaml title="Microsoft SSO configuration"
auth:
  # Tell the platform to use microsoft authentication
  microsoft:
    #
    #
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # ClientID of the microsoft application. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret of the microsoft application. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/microsoft/callback
    redirectURI: https://vcluster-platform.my.domain/auth/microsoft/callback
    #
    #
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) tenant configuration parameter controls what kinds of accounts
    # may be authenticated in loft. By default, all types of Microsoft
    # accounts (consumers and organizations) can authenticate in loft via Microsoft.
    # To change this, set the tenant parameter to one of the following:
    # common - both personal and business accounts can authenticate via Microsoft (default)
    # consumers - only personal accounts can authenticate in loft
    # organizations - only business/school accounts can authenticate in loft
    # 'tenant uuid' or 'tenant name' - only accounts belonging to specific tenant
    # identified by either 'tenant uuid' or 'tenant name' can authenticate in loft
    tenant: common
    # (Optional) It is possible to require a user to be a member of a particular
    # group in order to be successfully authenticated in loft.
    groups: []
    # (Optional) Configuration option restricts the list to include only security groups.
    # By default all groups (security, Office 365, mailing lists) are included.
    onlySecurityGroups: false
    # (Optional) Restrict the groups claims to include only the user’s groups
    # that are in the configured groups
    useGroupsAsWhitelist: false
```
