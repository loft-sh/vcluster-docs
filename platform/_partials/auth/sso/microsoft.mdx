To configure the platform to use Microsoft for SSO, navigate to `Admin > Config` in the platform and adjust your config as shown below:

```yaml title="Microsoft SSO configuration"
auth:
  # Tell the platform to use microsoft authentication
  microsoft:
    #
    #
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # ClientID of the microsoft application. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret of the microsoft application. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/microsoft/callback
    redirectURI: https://vcluster-platform.my.domain/auth/microsoft/callback
    #
    #
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) tenant configuration parameter controls what kinds of accounts
    # may be authenticated in loft. By default, all types of Microsoft
    # accounts (consumers and organizations) can authenticate in loft via Microsoft.
    # To change this, set the tenant parameter to one of the following:
    # common - both personal and business accounts can authenticate via Microsoft (default)
    # consumers - only personal accounts can authenticate in loft
    # organizations - only business/school accounts can authenticate in loft
    # 'tenant uuid' or 'tenant name' - only accounts belonging to specific tenant
    # identified by either 'tenant uuid' or 'tenant name' can authenticate in loft
    tenant: common
    # (Optional) It is possible to require a user to be a member of a particular
    # group in order to be successfully authenticated in loft.
    groups: []
    # (Optional) Configuration option restricts the list to include only security groups.
    # By default all groups (security, Office 365, mailing lists) are included.
    onlySecurityGroups: false
    # (Optional) Restrict the groups claims to include only the userâ€™s groups
    # that are in the configured groups
    useGroupsAsWhitelist: false
```
