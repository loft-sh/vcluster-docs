## Introduction to SAML authentication
<!-- vale on -->

[Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
Specification](https://saml.xml.org/saml-specifications) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly between an identity provider and a service provider. SAML is useful for implementing secure single sign-on (SSO) in enterprise environments, allowing users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.

:::caution Refresh tokens are not supported
The SAML 2.0 connector in the platform does not support refresh tokens as the SAML 2.0 protocol does not provide a way to requery a provider without interaction. For more information, see the [dex documentation for SAML 2.0](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/saml/).

<Step>
**Create platform Config For SAML v2.0**

The platform can use SAML v2.0 flow to identify the end user. To configure the platform to use SAML for SSO, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to `Admin > Config` in the platform.
2. Adjust your configuration as shown in the example below.
3. Obtain the necessary values from your SAML identity provider (IdP) for the required fields.

```yaml title="Configure the platform to use SAML"
auth:
  # Tell vCluster Platform to use saml authentication
  saml:
    #
    #
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # SSO URL used for POST value.
    ssoURL: https://saml.example.com/sso
    # CA to use when validating the signature of the SAML response.
    ca: /path/to/ca.pem
    # Alternatively, CA can be provided inline as a base64-encoded blob
    # caData: (RAW base64-encoded PEM encoded CA)
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-vcluster-platform-domain/auth/saml/callback
    redirectURI: https://vcluster-platform.my.domain/auth/saml/callback
    # Name of attributes in the returned assertions to map to ID token claims.
    usernameAttr: name
    emailAttr: email
    groupsAttr: groups # optional
    #
    #
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) List of groups to filter access based on membership
    allowedGroups: ["Admins"]
    # (Optional) To skip signature validation, uncomment the following field. This should
    # only be used during testing and may be removed in the future
    insecureSkipSignatureValidation: true
    # (Optional) Manually specify vCluster Platform's Issuer value.
    # When provided vCluster Platform will include this as the Issuer value during AuthnRequest.
    # It will also override the redirectURI as the required audience when evaluating
    # AudienceRestriction elements in the response.
    entityIssuer: https://vcluster-platform.my.domain/auth/saml/callback
    # (Optional) Issuer value expected in the SAML response.
    ssoIssuer: https://saml.example.com/sso
    # (Optional) Delimiter for splitting groups returned as a single string.
    #
    # By default, multiple groups are assumed to be represented as multiple
    # attributes with the same name.
    #
    # If "groupsDelim" is provided groups are assumed to be represented as a
    # single attribute and the delimiter is used to split the attribute's value
    # into multiple groups.
    groupsDelim: ", "
    # (Optional) Requested format of the NameID.
    #
    # The NameID value is is mapped to the user ID of the user. This can be an
    # abbreviated form of the full URI with just the last component. For example,
    # if this value is set to "emailAddress" the format will resolve to:
    #
    #     urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress
    #
    # If no value is specified, this value defaults to:
    #
    #     urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent
    #
    nameIDPolicyFormat: persistent
```

</Step>

<Step>

**Authenticate via SAML**

1. The platform should restart automatically.
2. You should now be able to log in via SAML.
3. Test the authentication by logging out and logging back in.
