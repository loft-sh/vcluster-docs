Parameters are a very powerful component of templates. These parameters allow
for giving users that may consume your template a bit of flexibility with
configuration options for certain applications, while still maintaining control over the
possible values the users can select.

When deploying a resource referring to a template with parameters configured, the platform
prompts the user for their selection for the given parameters.

## Parameter definition

Parameters are provided as YAML data structures. For example, with a parameters
configuration as shown below, the user gets a dialog box where they can select 'one' or
'two' as the value for the `mylabelvalue` variable.

```yaml title="dialog box for user input"
- variable: mylabelvalue
  label: StatefulSet Label
  description: Please select the value for the statefulset "my-label" key
  options:
    - one
    - two
  section: Labels
```

:::info
Parameter types can be one of the following:
- string
- multiline
- boolean
- number
- password
:::

Parameters can also be free-form text fields that are optionally validated. The following
snippet shows an example option that accepts a user input string and validates it against the
`validation` regular expression:

```yaml title="free-form text field"
- variable: anotherlabelvalue
  label: AnImportantValue
  description: Please enter this very important value
  section: Important Values
  required: true
  validation: "^\w+{8,63}$"
```

## Accessing parameter values

The value of Parameters can be accessed in the rest of the resource definition. If you have worked
with [go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template), this will be very familiar to you, but
even if you haven't it is quite simple. Values can be accessed in your teamplate using the `{{ .Values.
myvalue }}` notation -- where `myvalue` is the name of in the `variable` field of your
Parameters declaration.


```yaml title="accessing parameter values"
labels:
  my-label: "{{ .Values.mylabelvalue }}"
```

## Parameter values

In addition to user created parameters, the platform controller always merges in some
platform-specific parameters that are also available to you. The available parameters differ
slightly depending on where you are deploying the resource associated with the template.
These values are behind the `vCluster Platform` key.

| Object                  | YAML Key                  | Value                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project                 | `project`                 | The name of the project that contains the space/virtualcluster the app is being deployed into |
| Space                   | `space`                   | The name of the space (if applicable) the app is being deployed into                          |
| VirtualCluster          | `virtualClusterName`      | The name of the virtual cluster (if applicable) the app is being deployed into                |
| Cluster                 | `cluster`                 | The name of the cluster the space/virtualcluster (and by extension the app) is in             |
| VirtualClusterNamespace | `virtualClusterNamespace` | The namespace the virtualcluster is in                                                        |

With this you could access the `virtualClusterName` as follows:

```yaml title="accessing platform parameters"
labels:
  my-label: "{{ .Values.loft.virtualClusterName }}"
```
