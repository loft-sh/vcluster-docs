A new cluster can be connected to the platform through the UI or CLI:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ui"
  values={[
    {label: 'UI', value: 'ui'},
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'Helm', value: 'helm'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ui">
    <PartialClusterConnectUI />
        :::tip Connect a cluster
UI will generate a CLI command that can be used to connect the cluster. Make
sure to check the `CLI` tab for working with the command.
:::


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">
    <PartialClusterConnectCLI />


  :::info platform login
    <ConnectPlatform />

  If your kubectl context is not set to the cluster with running platform, it's
  possible to login to the platform using the CLI and access key.
  If you haven't already, you need to [create access key](/docs/platform/api/authentication#create-an-access-key) to be able to login to the platform.

  ```bash title="Login to the platform using access key"
  vcluster platform login [platform-url] --access-key [access-key]
  ```

  :::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="helm">
    <PartialClusterConnectHelm />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When connecting a new cluster, the user creates a new cluster resource and obtains
a pre-shared key (PSK) that the user then uses to bootstrap the agent.
The agent then utilizes this key to reach the control plane, authenticate itself,
and establish a secure WireGuard-based, user-space tunnel.

<EnrollmentSvg width="100%"/>

If the agent cannot establish a direct WireGuard-based connection, the agents
falls back to utilising the control plane as a Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets.
The control plane relay is comparable to the same role as TURN servers in the ICE
standard, using HTTPS streams (or WebSockets) and WireGuards keys instead.

If you encounter issues while configuring agent values or deploying it manually, you might want to take a look at the [Cluster troubleshooting](advanced/cluster-troubleshooting.mdx) guide.
