vCluster Platform provides direct integration with Prometheus. With the recommended app `kube-prometheus-stack, a complete monitoring setup can be enabled in your cluster with a single click.

To use the prometheus integration, you must install the `kube-prometheus-stack` application from within the platform.

## Install `kube-prometheus-stack`

Navigate to **Clusters** -> **CLUSTER** -> **Overview** and click the recommended app `kube-prometheus-stack`.

```yaml
# Required values by vCluster Platform

```

After selecting **Install**, wait until the `kube-prometheus-stack` is installed.

Congratulations, you now have a complete monitoring system with vCluster Platform and Prometheus!
