This guide explains how to migrate the platform to a different Kubernetes cluster, which may be necessary during cluster decommissioning or cloud platform migration.

## Use cases
- Decommissioning the cluster where the platform is installed
- Migrating the platform to a different cluster while cleaning up the original cluster
- Migrating the platform to a new cluster and keeping the original cluster as a connected cluster

## Scope

The platform on a dedicated Kubernetes cluster with its own ingress and DNS record

### Out of scope
The following scenarios require different migration approaches and are not covered in this guide:
- The platform that uses the Loft router (with hostname `<something.loft.host>`) - requires special DNS handling
- The platform that is deployed or managed by an automated deployment tool like `ArgoCD` - requires coordination with GitOps workflows
- The platform with virtual cluster instances running on the same Kubernetes host cluster - these instances require separate migration after the platform migration
- The destination Kubernetes cluster has a virtual cluster agent - requires agent decommissioning first

## Prerequisites

### Base prerequisites
<BasePrerequisites />

### Platform specific prerequisites
- Storage space for backup (approximately 1GB)
- Access to DNS management for the platform's domain
- Only one platform instance can exist per Kubernetes cluster. Do not install the platform twice in the same Kubernetes host cluster.
- The migration process requires 15-30 minutes of downtime. Communicate this downtime to end users.
- The source and destination installations must use the same platform version. Version changes during migration are not supported.

## Migration steps

<Flow id="migration procedure">

### Install the platform in the new cluster
<Step>
Configuration

- Use the Helm values from the original installation, making adjustments to values like `ingressClass` or `storageClass` as necessary
- If your project namespaces have the "loft-p-" prefix, set `projectNamespacePrefix: loft-p-` in your configuration
</Step>

<Step>
Installation

Install the platform in the new cluster following the [quick start guide](/platform/install/quick-start-guide).

:::info Avoid DNS conflicts
When using cloud-managed ingress, use a temporary hostname to prevent conflicts with the running platform instance.
:::
</Step>

### Prepare for migration

<Step>
Send downtime communication to end users
</Step>

<Step>
Optional: stop `ArgoCD` sync of any virtual clusters
</Step>

<Step>
[Perform a backup of the source platform](/platform/administer/backup-restore/backup-restore-platform)
</Step>

### Execute migration

<Step>
Scale down the source platform:

```bash title="Scale down the platform deployment"
kubectl scale deployment loft --replicas=0 -n vcluster-platform
```
</Step>

<Step>
[Restore the backup to the new installation](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/administer/backup-restore/backup-restore-platform#restoring-vcluster-platform-from-backup)
</Step>

<Step>
Apply the license certificate to the new cluster:

  ```bash title="Apply license certificate"
  TARGET_NAMESPACE='vcluster-platform'
  CA_CERT=$(kubectl get secret loft-cert -n vcluster-platform -o jsonpath="{.data.ca\.crt}")
  TLS_CERT=$(kubectl get secret loft-cert -n vcluster-platform -o jsonpath="{.data.tls\.crt}")
  PRIVATE_KEY=$(kubectl get secret loft-cert -n vcluster-platform -o jsonpath="{.data.tls\.key}")

  cat <<EOF > loft-cert-clean.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: loft-cert
    namespace: ${TARGET_NAMESPACE}
  type: kubernetes.io/tls
  data:
    ca.crt: ${CA_CERT}
    tls.crt: ${TLS_CERT}
    tls.key: ${PRIVATE_KEY}
  EOF
  ```

  ```bash title="Apply license certificate"
  kubectl scale deployment loft --replicas=0 -n vcluster-platform
  kubectl delete secret loft-cert -n ${TARGET_NAMESPACE} --ignore-not-found
  kubectl create -f loft-cert-clean.yaml
  ```

</Step>
<Step>
Update the hostname in the platform configuration as described in the [configuration guide](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/configure/config#changing-the-lofthost-variable)
</Step>
<Step>
Update the DNS record to point to the new cluster if needed
</Step>
<Step>
If the original cluster is going to be used as a connected cluster: connect it to the new platform installation
</Step>

</Flow>

## Post-migration validation
<Flow id="post-migration validation">
<Step>
Log in to the platform UI and verify object presence:
   - Check for all expected projects
   - Verify user access and permissions
   - Confirm virtual cluster listings
</Step>
<Step>
Verify license status in the platform UI:
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ License
   - Confirm license is active and correct
</Step>
<Step>
Restart platform agents on connected clusters:

  ```bash title="Restart platform agents"
  kubectl rollout restart deployment loft -n vcluster-platform
  ```
</Step>
<Step>
Validate the core capabilities of the platform:
   - Single Sign-on: test login with all configured providers
   - Log access: verify log retrieval from multiple virtual clusters
   - Virtual cluster creation: create a test cluster
   - Sleep mode: test sleep/wake feature
</Step>
<Step>
Optional: restart `ArgoCD` sync if previously stopped
</Step>
<Step>
Send end-of-downtime communication to end users
</Step>
</Flow>
