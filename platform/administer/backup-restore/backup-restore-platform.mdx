This guide describes how to backup and restore the vCluster Platform management plane. To back up the connected clusters, reuse a regular Kubernetes backup solution such as [Velero](https://velero.io/).

The vCluster Platform saves its state as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) objects. You can back up this state using [Velero](https://velero.io) or a special vCluster CLI command we created for convenience. This command saves all relevant Kubernetes resources to a single file.

You can run the vCluster CLI to back up these components at any time. The backup includes the following resources:

- `ClusterRoleTemplates`
- `ClusterAccesses`
- `SpaceConstraints`
- `Users`
- `Teams`
- `SharedSecrets`
- `AccessKeys`
- `Apps`
- `SpaceTemplates`
- `VirtualClusterTemplates`
- `Clusters` and associated Kubernetes `Secret` objects
- `Projects`
- `VirtualClusterInstances`
- `SpaceInstances`
- `ProjectSecrets`

The platform backup includes only Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). It does not include other resources used by the platform deployment or connected clusters, such as persistent volumes that store cost data. Use a Kubernetes backup solution such as [Velero](https://velero.io) to back up these resources separately.

To create a backup using the default settings, run the following command. It saves the manifests for all of the components listed above to a file named `backup.yaml` in the current directory:

```bash
vcluster platform backup management
```

Alternatively, you cab specify the name for the backup file by running the command as:

```bash
vcluster platform backup management --filename vcluster-platform-backup.yaml
```

In some cases, the vCluster Platform might have been installed in a different namespace instead of the default `vcluster-platform`. If so, you can specify the correct namespace as shown in the following command:

```bash
vcluster platform backup management --namespace my-namespace
```

You can also exclude specific components from the backup by passing their names as a comma-separated list. The following example excludes `users` and `teams` from the backup:

```bash
vcluster platform backup management --skip users,teams
```

### Restore vCluster Platform from backup

The backup YAML file contains the resource manifests for the vCluster Platform management plane. You can apply it like any standard Kubernetes manifest.

To restore, apply the backup to your cluster using the following command:

:::note
The backup contains vCluster Platform Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), which must be installed in the cluster for the restore to succeed.
:::

```bash
kubectl apply -f <backup-filename>.yaml
```

You might see warning messages similar to the following:

```
Warning: resource apps/argocd is missing the kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration annotation which is required by kubectl apply. kubectl apply should only be used on resources created declaratively by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply. The missing annotation is patched automatically.
```

These are just warnings and should not affect the restoration task.

:::warning Multiple Kubernetes clusters with the same vCluster Platform config
Do not install vCluster Platform (or its agents) into a cluster where it is already running. Running multiple vCluster Platform instances in the same cluster can cause reconciliation conflicts and lead to unexpected issues.
