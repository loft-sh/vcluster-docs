The database connector feature allows an admin to configure a database server to manage backing stores for multiple virtual clusters. For each virtual cluster, the feature automatically creates an independent database and non-privileged user. Read more about the use of external databases in the [External Database documentation](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/database/external).

:::note
This feature currently only supports MySQL database servers. It has been extensively tested for AWS RDS MySQL compatibility.
:::

## Prerequisites

<BasePrerequisites />

- A running MySQL server and admin credentials to the server

## Configuration

### Create platform admin connector secret

A connector secret is a secret that can be used with a platform feature or integration.

For the platform to start using a database server, a secret must be created that contains admin credentials for the server. The secret must:
- Contain the `loft.sh/connector-type` label with the `shared-database` value
- Reside in the same namespace as the platform
- Contain the fields:
  - endpoint
  - password
  - port
  - user

The template for a shared database connector secret is:

```yaml title="Shared database secret template"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <name> # this is a normal metadata name. A descriptive name is recommended. This will be used in a tenet vCluster's config to reference the connector secret
  namespace: <vcluster-platform-namespace> # this is the namespace that vCluster Platform is installed in. "vcluster-platform" and "loft" are common values.
  labels:
    loft.sh/connector-type: "shared-database"
stringData:
  endpoint: <endpoint> # this could be a service endoint or an external hostname endpoint
  password: <password>
  port: <port> # 3306 is a common port for database servers
  user: <user>
```

Use the following `kubectl` command to create the secret:

```bash title="Create a shared database connector secret"
kubectl create secret generic default-secret-name \
  --namespace=vcluster-platform \
  --from-literal=endpoint="your-database-endpoint" \
  --from-literal=password="your-database-password" \
  --from-literal=port="3306" \
  --from-literal=user="your-database-user" \
  -o yaml --dry-run=client > secret.yaml
```

## Use virtual cluster with shared database

A new virtual cluster can now reference the created connector secret by setting the `controlPlane.backingStore.database.external.connector` field in the virtual cluster config to the `name` of the connector secret.

:::warning
Modifying a database secret to point to a different database server is not recommended and may lead to data loss.
:::

### Example configuration

The following example is a connector secret for the shared database feature. It is configured for an internal instance of MySQL that is exposed with a ClusterIP service named `mysql` in the `vcluster-platform` namespace (assume this is the namespace the platform is installed in). This could instead be any other endpoint, such as an AWS RDS MySQL endpoint.

```yaml title="Shared database secret example"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: default-data-source
  namespace: vcluster-platform # this must match the namespace that vCluster Platform is in
  labels:
    loft.sh/connector-type: "shared-database"
stringData:
  endpoint: mysql.vcluster-platform # this service could be in any namespace
  password: <password>
  port: "3306"
  user: root
```
