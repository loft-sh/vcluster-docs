description: Learn how to use Database Connectors with vCluster
---

The database connector feature allows an admin to configure a database server to be used to manage backing stores for multiple virtual clusters. For each virtual cluster, the feature automatically creates individual databases and
creates a non-privileged user. Read more about vCluster's using of external
databases in the [vCluster External Database docs](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/database/external).


:::note
This feature currently only supports MySQL database servers. It has been extensively tested for AWS RDS MySQL compatibility.
:::


### Requirements

You must have a running MySQL server and admin credentials to the server.

### Create platform admin connector secret

A connector secret is a secret that can be used with a platform feature or integration.

For platform to start using a database server, a secret must be created that contains admin credentials for the server. The secret must:
* Contain the `loft.sh/connector-type` label with the `shared-database` value.
* Reside in the same namespace as the platform.
* Contain the fields:
    * endpoint
    * password
    * port
    * user

The template for a shared database connector secret is:
```yaml title="Shared database secret template"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: <name> # this is a normal metadata name. A descriptive name is recommended. This will be used in a tenet vCluster's config to reference the connector secret
  namespace: <vcluster-platform-namespace> # this is the namespace that vCluster Platform is installed in. "vcluster-platform" and "loft" are common values.
  labels:
    loft.sh/connector-type: "shared-database"
stringData:
  endpoint: <endpoint> # this could be a service endoint or an external hostname endpoint
  password: <password>
  port: <port> # 3306 is a common port for database servers
  user: <user>

```

1. Replace all values surrounded by angular brackets with your own value and save to a file as `<filename>`.
2. Create the secret: `kubectl create -f <filename>`

That's it. A new vCluster can now reference the created connector secret by setting the `controlPlane.backingStore.database.external.connector` field in the vCluster config
to the `name` of the connector secret.

:::warning Modifying a database secret to point to a different database server is not recommended and may lead to data loss.

#### Example

The following example is a connector secret for the shared database feature. It is configured for an internal instance of mysql that is exposed
with a ClusterIP service named `mysql` in the `vcluster-platform` namespace
(assume this is the namespace the platform is installed in). This could
instead be any other endpoint, such as an AWS RDS MySQL endpoint.

```yaml title="Shared database secret example"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: default-data-source
  namespace: vcluster-platform # this must match the namespace that vCluster Platform is in
  labels:
    loft.sh/connector-type: "shared-database"
stringData:
  endpoint: mysql.vcluster-platform # this service could be in any namespace
  password: <password>
  port: "3306"
  user: root

```
