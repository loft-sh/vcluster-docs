# Management access to the virtual cluster

Management access controls who can view, edit, or configure the virtual cluster object in the platform. It is separate from in-cluster access, which governs permissions inside the Kubernetes environment of the virtual cluster.

## Default management access

By default, the following users and roles have management access to a virtual cluster:

* **Global administrators** – Access all virtual clusters on the platform.
* **Project administrators** – Access all virtual clusters within their assigned projects.
* **Virtual cluster owners** – Automatically receive access to the specific virtual cluster they create or own.
* **Users with physical cluster permissions** – Any user or team with RBAC permissions on the underlying (physical) cluster and the `use` verb on the `virtualclusterinstances` resource in the `management.loft.sh` API group can access virtual clusters running on that cluster.

## Grant management access using the UI

To extend access to additional users or teams, use the **Permissions** section for each virtual cluster in the platform UI:

<Flow id="grant-management-access">
  <Step>
  Open the **Project** dropdown in the top-left corner and select the project that contains the virtual cluster.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Virtual Clusters** in the sidebar to view the list.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Edit** on the target virtual cluster.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Open the **Permissions** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Use the **Add permission to** field to select the user or team.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  If the user or team does not appear, confirm that they have access to the project.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Choose a **ClusterRole** to assign (e.g., `cluster-admin`, `edit`, or `view`). This role determines the user's Kubernetes permissions inside the virtual cluster.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Click **Save changes**.
  </Step>
</Flow>

The platform grants the selected user or team management access to the virtual cluster object.

## vCluster roles

vCluster roles define what users and teams can do inside the virtual cluster. Kubernetes RBAC governs this access.

### Default cluster role assignment

By default, the platform assigns the `cluster-admin` Kubernetes ClusterRole to users with virtual cluster access. This role grants full access in all namespaces.

### Change the default cluster role

Administrators can override the default role in the virtual cluster template or in the virtual cluster configuration.

<Flow id="change-default-role">
  <Step>
  Open the virtual cluster or template configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Locate the **Default Cluster Role** field.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Enter a more limited role such as `edit` or `view`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Save the updated configuration.
  </Step>
</Flow>

### Define custom role mapping rules

Use mapping rules to assign specific users or teams to specific cluster roles.

- A user or team that matches at least one rule does **not** receive the default role.
- If multiple rules match, the system assigns all specified roles.
- If no rule matches, the system assigns the default role.

<Flow id="configure-role-mapping">
  <Step>
  Open the virtual cluster or template YAML configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Locate or create the `access.rules` section.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  List `subjects` for each user or team.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Define the `ClusterRole` for each rule.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  Save and apply the configuration.
  </Step>
</Flow>

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: VirtualCluster
metadata:
  name: example-vcluster
spec:
  defaultClusterRole: cluster-admin
  access:
    rules:
      - subjects:
          - kind: User
            name: Person 1
        clusterRole: edit
      - subjects:
          - kind: Team
            name: DevTeam
        clusterRole: view
```

In this example:

- Person 1 receives the `edit` role.
- DevTeam receives the `view` role.
- Person 1, if part of DevTeam, receives both roles.
- All other users default to `cluster-admin`.

Custom mapping rules allow more precise and secure access control inside the virtual cluster.
