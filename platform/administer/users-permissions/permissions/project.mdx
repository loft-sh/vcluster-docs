Members are users or teams that are granted access to a project. Each member is assigned a role that
define their permissions. These roles will be granted to each of the [allowed clusters](../../projects/allowed/clusters.mdx) of the
project. Only users and teams that are members of the project have access to the project's
allowed clusters.

If you don't have a project, you can create one by following instructions [here](../../secrets/project/create).

## Project Roles

There are 3 default roles available for every project.

| Name           | Create New Spaces / Virtual Clusters | Access Spaces / Virtual Clusters        | Create Without Template | Create With Template | Access to Project Secrets                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Project admin  | Yes                                  | All Spaces and Virtual Clusters         | Yes                     | Yes                  | Yes                                                 |
| Project User   | Yes                                  | Only owned and with explicit permission | No                      | Yes                  | Yes                                                 |
| Project Viewer | No                                   | Only with explicit permission           | No                      | No                   | Only in Spaces and Virtual Clusters with permission |
