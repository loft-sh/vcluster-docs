Access Keys in vCluster Platform are used for authentication to vCluster Platform via the vCluster CLI, or by any HTTP
utilities (i.e. curl). Access Keys can be generated by any vCluster Platform user, the generated Access Key
will provide the key's user with the same permissions as the user who generated the key.

Access Keys may optionally be scoped, that is, have their access limited to a particular vCluster Platform project,
virtual cluster, or namespace. However, scoped access only allows the access key permissions to the resources the user
or team has access to already. This is a great option to use for keys generated for automated processes such as a CI pipeline.
