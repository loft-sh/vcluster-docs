# Custom roles in vCluster platform

## Overview

When you add a user to a project or cluster in vCluster, you assign them a role. The role determines which actions they can take in the vCluster platform.

If you add a user to both a project's parent namespace and the project itself, the higher role permission level is used.

vCluster administrators have all permissions.

## Roles

You can assign users a default role or a custom role.

The available default roles are:

- **Viewer**
- **Editor**
- **Admin**
- **Owner**
- **Minimal Access** (available for top-level spaces only)

A user assigned the Viewer role has the least permissions, and the Owner has the most.

## Project members permissions

A user's role determines what permissions they have on a project. The Owner role provides all permissions but is available only:

- For namespace and project Owners
- For vCluster Administrators

For more information about how to manage project members, see members of a project.

The following tables list the project permissions available for each role.

## Users with minimal access

Users with the Minimal Access role do not:

- Automatically have access to projects and subspaces in that top-level namespace
- Count as licensed seats in enterprise subscriptions, provided the user has no other role anywhere in the instance

Owners must explicitly add these users to specific subspaces and projects.

You can use the Minimal Access role with SAML SSO for enterprise spaces to control access to spaces and projects in the namespace hierarchy. You can set the default role to Minimal Access for members automatically added to the top-level namespace through SSO.

1. Navigate to your namespace
2. Select **Settings > Authentication**
3. From the **Default membership role** dropdown list, select **Minimal Access**
4. Select **Save changes**
