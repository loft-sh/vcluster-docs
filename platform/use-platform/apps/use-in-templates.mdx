Apps are a way for admins to package applications and scripts in consumable packages.
These applications can then be deployed into namesspaces or virtual clusters through their templates.

Virtual clusters or namespaces combined with Apps are a great way to create repeatable, pre-packaged
development, testing, or even production environments. Once an App has been created in the vCluster Platform
instance, it can be installed into any virtual cluster or namespace -- either at time of creation, or into
existing resources. This gives administrators the capability to create fully populated
development, test, or even production, environments in a single easy to manage package.

Templates can take this combination of virtual clusters/namespaces and apps to the next
level, by creating simple, reusable, version-able templates that define a reproducible environment.When an App is included in
a template, that app will be deployed in the given resource upon creation.
