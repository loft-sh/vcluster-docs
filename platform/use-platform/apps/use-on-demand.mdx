Apps are a way for admins to package applications and scripts in consumable packages.
These applications can then be deployed into clusters, namespaces, or virtual clusters managed by vCluster Platform.
This can be a useful tool for adding pre-defined applications to newly connected clusters, or to
newly created namespaces or virtual clusters that are not already using a template that includes Apps.

## Installing Apps on a Virtual Cluster

Virtual clusters combined with Apps are a great way to create repeatable, pre-packaged
development, testing, or even production environments. Once an App has been created in the vCluster Platform
instance, it can be installed into any virtual cluster -- either at time of creation, or into
existing virtual clusters. This gives administrators the capability to create fully populated
development, test, or even production, environments in a single easy to manage package.

      <Step>
          From the project drop-down menu (top left corner), select the project you'd like to create the
          virtual cluster in.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click on <NavStep>Virtual Clusters</NavStep>.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click the <Button>New Virtual Cluster</Button> button. Do not select a template.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        <b>[Optional]</b> Select the cluster in which to create the virtual
        cluster.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click the <Button>Configure</Button> to continue.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Click the <Label>Apps</Label> configuration tab. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <b>Note:</b>
        The apps defined in this section of the configuration are apps to
        be deployed *in* the virtual cluster.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        From the drop down menu <Label>Please select an App...</Label>, select an
        application that you would like to be deployed. You can
        select as many as you would like by simply selecting another
        application from the drop down menu. If you accidentally add one, or add one you
        do not want, click the trash icon next to the names of the applications to remove it
        from the configuration.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        For each application that you added to the template, you can configure the default
        namespace, and any parameters supplied by the application. For Helm applications, you
        can also configure the Helm release-name.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Finish configuring anything else you'd like on your virtual cluster,
        then click the
        <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
