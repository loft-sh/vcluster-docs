Each virtual cluster that is created in the platform belongs to a [project](../../../understand/what-are-projects.mdx). There are two primary ways which
virtual clusters can be created: from a template or manually.

Virtual clusters created from a [template](../../../understand/what-are-templates.mdx)
settings. Standard project users (non project admins) are only allowed to create virtual clusters
from templates that the project admin has allowed. This ensures that virtual clusters in
each project adhere to the standards set by the project admin.

Project admins and platform admins can create virtual clusters manually, that is without a template.


Once you have created a virtual cluster template you can then refer to that template when
creating a new virtual cluster. All template configurations will be automatically applied to the
newly created virtual cluster. Virtual clusters referring to templates can be created in the UI
or via the vCluster CLI.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ui"
  values={[
    { label: "UI", value: "ui" },
    { label: "CLI", value: "cli" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="ui">
    <PartialVirtualClusterCreateUI />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">
    <PartialVirtualClusterCreateCLI />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Template Version Strings

Regardless of how you create a virtual cluster from a template, either by the UI or the CLI, you will be prompted to provide a template version string. If you do not provide this string, the latest
version will be automatically selected for you. If you _do_ provide the string though, you can
do something very neat -- you can set any of the MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH version components to an
`X` wildcard character. This allows the virtual cluster to be automatically updated to a more recent
template version that matches your provided template string.

For example, given a template with a version of 1.0.0, and a virtual cluster created from this
template with a version string "1.X.X". Adding a new template version "1.1.0", will cause this
virtual cluster to be automatically updated. Whereas adding a new version "2.0.0", will _not_
cause the virtual cluster to be upgraded.

This is a very handy way to keep virtual clusters up to date with the latest templates without
having to manually upgrade them.

Note that you can even set the version to "X.X.X" to _always_ have your virtual cluster updated
to the latest template version.
