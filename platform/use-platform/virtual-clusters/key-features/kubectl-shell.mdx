# Kubectl shell

The Kubectl Shell feature is terminal that is connected to a pod containing kubectl, among other tools. The pod exists in the target vCluster within the namespace `vcluster-platform-shell`.
A kubeconfig is mounted to the pod with a vCluster scoped AccessKey. This means the AccessKey cannot be used to access other resources in vCluster Platform. The Kubectl Shell Pod and AccessKey
will automatically be cleaned up after 15 mintues of inactivity. To learn more about the security implications and options for security hardening, read the [Security Considerations section](#security-considerations).

## How to use

The Kubectl Shell feature can be accessed in the Project Overiew page under the ellipsis menu for any vCluster row. The Kubectl Shell feature can also be accessed on the vCluster
Config page under the ellipsis menu.

## Who can use it

Any user who has access to the VirtualClusterInstance, VirtualClusterInstances/Shell, and pod/exec permissions for the `vcluster-browser-shell` namespace within the vCluster can use the Kubectl Shell feature.
Read the [Security Consideration section](#security-considerations) to understand the implications of granting these aforementioned permissions.

## Security considerations

Required permissions for this feature should only be given to users who are otherwise vCluster admins. vCluster admins, not to be confused with vCluster Platform admins, are any users who have full access or
effectively full access to perform sensitive actions within the targetted vCluster.

The Kubectl Shell pods exist within the vCluster in the `vcluster-platform-shell` namespace. The kubeconfig is mounted from a secret that also exists in the `vcluster-platform-shell` namespace.
Any user that has access to either exec into pods or get secrets in the `vcluster-platform-shell` have access to the kubeconfig and the AccessKey token embedded within the kubeconfig. The AccessKey
is scoped to the vCluster, meaning it can only be used to access vCluster related resources and cannot be used to access any other resources in the vCluster Platform. Consequently, these permissions
should only be granted to users who would be considered admins for the targetted vCluster. It is common for all users with access to a vCluster to effectively be admins for that vCluster. Pod exec
permissions are a sensitive privilege and should only be given to vCluster admins regardless. Use normal Kubernetes RBAC to configure who has access to the
`vcluster-platform-shell` namespace.
