If you want to enforce policies using Kyverno, and don't want to manage as many Kyverno installations as you have vClusters, you can make use of the External Admission Enforcement feature to enforce policies inside your vClusters with a single Kyverno installation.

# Install Kyverno

For the purpose of this guide, you should have Kyverno installed on your host cluster.
You can either install it by running the following command or head [here](https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/methods/) to install it differently.

```bash
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases/download/v1.10.0/install.yaml
```

# Create a Kyverno policy

After installing Kyverno, create the following (or the one of your chosing) policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-labels
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/title: Add Labels
    policies.kyverno.io/category: Sample
    policies.kyverno.io/minversion: 1.6.0
    policies.kyverno.io/severity: medium
    policies.kyverno.io/subject: Label
    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Labels are used as an important source of metadata describing objects in various ways
      or triggering other functionality. Labels are also a very basic concept and should be
      used throughout Kubernetes. This policy performs a simple mutation which adds a label
      `foo=bar` to Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
spec:
  rules:
  - name: add-labels
    match:
      any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - Pod
          - Service
          - ConfigMap
          - Secret
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            foo: bar
```

# Import the hook into the vCluster

Once the policy is created, this will update the `kyverno-resource-mutating-webhook-cfg`
(or the corresponding validatingwebhookconfiguration) with the relevant resources and namespaces.
You will need to copy this configuration into your values files or your template for it to be applied
inside the vCluster in the `.admission.mutatingWebhooks` as a string.

Once the vCluster is updated with that configuration, objects will have to go through the Kyverno hooks
and will be modified (or validated) accordingly.

# Caveats

Make sure that your Kyverno hooks don't rely on the host cluster's namespaces or logic tied to the
specifics of it, since the objects that are going to reach it will have the object's raw metadata
(and will for example reference namespaces that are only present inside the vCluster)
