Users that can access the platform.

## Platform-specific verbs

In addition to standard Kubernetes RBAC verbs (`get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`), the User resource supports these platform-specific verbs for access control:

| Verb | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bind` | Required when adding a user to ClusterAccess rules or other access rules. Allows granting the user permissions on platform resources. |
| `makeowner` | Required when changing the owner of a resource to a user. Allows transferring ownership of projects, virtual clusters, spaces, or other platform resources. |

### Example access rule with makeowner verb

```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: User
metadata:
  name: admin-user
spec:
  access:
    - name: user-management
      verbs:
        - get
        - update
        - makeowner
      users:
        - admin-user
```

## User example

An example User:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
