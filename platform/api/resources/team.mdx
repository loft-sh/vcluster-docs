Teams are composed of multiple users and define a way to manage cluster access or other objects for multiple users at once. You can assign users automatically to teams by their groups, which can be synced from an authentication provider. Teams can also access the platform through their own access keys and own spaces or other objects.

## Platform-specific verbs

In addition to standard Kubernetes RBAC verbs (`get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`), the Team resource supports these platform-specific verbs for access control:

| Verb | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bind` | Allows binding permissions to a team, enabling assignment of access rules and roles to that team. Required when adding a team to ClusterAccess rules. |
| `makeowner` | Allows transferring ownership of platform resources to a team. Used when changing the owner of projects, clusters, or other resources to a team. |

### Example access rule with bind verb

```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: platform-admins
spec:
  access:
    - name: team-management
      verbs:
        - get
        - update
        - bind
      users:
        - admin
```

## Team example

An example Team:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: my-team
spec:
  clusterRoles:
  - name: loft-management-admin
  description: All users in this team have full admin access to all clusters
  displayName: Global Admins
  groups:
