A virtual cluster is a certified Kubernetes distribution that operates within a namespace of a host Kubernetes cluster. Virtual clusters solve namespace limitations in multi-tenant environments by allowing users to deploy their own Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) or enable communication between pods across namespaces that would otherwise be restricted by standard [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#networkpolicy-resource).

## Virtual Cluster example

An example Virtual Cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: VirtualClusterInstance
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: my-virtual-cluster
  namespace: loft-p-my-project
spec:
  clusterRef: {}
  displayName: my-display-name
  owner:
    user: my-user
  parameters: 'my-parameter: my-value'
  templateRef:
    name: my-virtual-cluster-template
status: {}

```

### Verbs

The platform supports two categories of verbs that define what actions users can perform on resources. These categories determine how permissions are granted:
- **Standard verbs** map directly to Kubernetes API operations with corresponding HTTP methods.
- **Non-standard verbs** require explicit RBAC policy assignments.

The `verbs` array in the `access` object specifies which operations users and teams can perform on virtual cluster instances.

For more information, see the [Kubernetes authorization documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/).

   |------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
   | `get`            | GET                  | Retrieves virtual cluster instance from the UI and API.                                        | Standard     |
   | `list`           | GET                  | Lists collections of virtual cluster instances.                                                | Standard     |
   | `watch`          | GET with `?watch=1`  | Watches for changes to virtual cluster instances.                                              | Standard     |
   | `create`         | POST                 | Creates new virtual cluster instances.                                                         | Standard     |
   | `update`         | PATCH                | Updates existing virtual cluster instances from the UI.                                        | Standard     |
   | `patch`          | PATCH                | Partially modifies a virtual cluster instance through the API, without replacing the full specification. | Standard     |
   | `delete`         | DELETE               | Permanently removes a virtual cluster instance through the UI or API.                          | Standard     |
   | `deletecollection`| DELETE with filters | Removes multiple virtual cluster instances simultaneously, that match specified filter criteria (for example, using a label selector).  | Standard     |
   | `use`            | N/A                  | Grants access to a virtual cluster instance by fetching kubeconfig and connecting to enable managing resources within it. | Non-standard |
