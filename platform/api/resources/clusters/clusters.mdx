Connected Kubernetes clusters that can be managed through the platform. You can allow users and teams to access those clusters and they can create new spaces and virtual clusters inside them.

## Platform-specific verbs

In addition to standard Kubernetes RBAC verbs (`get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete`), the Cluster resource supports these platform-specific verbs for access control:

| Verb | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `bind` | Required when adding a cluster to ClusterAccess rules. Allows granting users or teams permission to create spaces and virtual clusters on the cluster. |
| `connectlocal` | Required when setting `spec.local: true` on a cluster. Allows connecting the local cluster (where the platform is installed) to the platform for management. |

### Example access rule with bind verb

```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: my-team
spec:
  access:
    - name: cluster-access
      verbs:
        - get
        - bind
      subresources:
        - clusters
      teams:
        - my-team
```

## Cluster example

An example Cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  config:
    secretName: my-kube-config-secret
    secretNamespace: my-kube-config-secret-namespace
  description: My AWS Cluster
  displayName: My Cluster
