**Connect to the Platform**: to use any `vcluster platform` command, you need to be connected to the platform.

When you started the platform, you would have automatically connected to the platform when you ran `vcluster platform start`.

If you aren't sure if you are connected and already have a running platform, then you can login. Before running this command, be sure that your kubecontext is set to the cluster running the platform.

```bash title="Login to the platform."
vcluster platform login
```
