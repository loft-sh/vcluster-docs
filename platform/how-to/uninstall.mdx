## Delete the platform

:::warning
This action is done against the cluster the kube-context is pointing to, and not the Platform instance that is logged in.
It does not require logging in to the Platform.
:::


VirtualClusterInstances managed with driver Helm are  deleted, but the underlying virtual clusters are not uninstalled

On the Kubernetes cluster where platform is installed, and all connected clusters, run: 


```bash
vcluster destroy platform
```

## Troubleshooting

If a resource is stuck/errored in deletion, you may have to investigate the logs and status of the stuck resource and remove it manually.

The command is retryable.
