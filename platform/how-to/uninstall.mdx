This guide provides instructions on how to uninstall the platform from your Kubernetes cluster.

:::warning
This action is performed against the cluster the kube-context is pointing to, not the platform instance that is logged in. It does not require logging in to the platform.
:::

## Prerequisites

<Prerequisites />

## Uninstall

There are two ways to uninstall the platform.

<VersionBadge vclusterVersion="v0.24" />

### Delete the platform

Note that the
[VirtualClusterInstances](/platform/api/resources/virtualclusterinstance)
CRDs managed with driver Helm are deleted, but the underlying virtual clusters
are not uninstalled.

On the Kubernetes cluster where the platform is installed, and all connected clusters, run:

```bash title="Delete the platform using vCluster CLI"
vcluster platform destroy
```

:::info
The command does the following:
- Uninstalls Helm releases related to Loft.
- Deletes CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) created by the platform.
- Optionally deletes the namespace where the platform is installed when the `--delete-namespace` flag is provided.
- Removes cluster roles and cluster role bindings created by the platform.
:::

In order to force delete all the platform resources, you can use the flag `--force-remove-finalizers`. This will remove the
finalizers from the resources, forcing the platform resources to be deleted immediately.

```bash title="Force delete the platform using vCluster CLI"
vcluster platform destroy --force-remove-finalizers
```

:::warning
Removing finalizers may cause unintended behaviors like leaving some resources behind, but will ensure the platform is uninstalled.

    <TabItem value="Using Helm">

### Delete Helm release

```bash title="Delete the platform Helm release"
helm delete -n vcluster-platform loft
```

### Delete namespace (optional)

Deleting the namespace ensures that all resources associated with the platform are removed. If you have deleted the namespace **without** deleting the vcluster-platform and loft-agent Helm releases beforehand, ensure the api-services and webhooks are deleted correctly:

```bash title="Delete API service and webhook"
kubectl delete apiservice v1.cluster.loft.sh
kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration loft-agent
```

### Delete CRDs (optional)

```bash title="Delete platform CRDs"
kubectl api-resources --api-group='storage.loft.sh' -o name | xargs kubectl delete crd
```

:::warning
Deleting the platform CRDs will also remove all platform objects inside your cluster, such as Cluster, Team, and User. This action cannot be undone.

## Troubleshooting

If a resource is stuck or encounters an error during deletion, refer to the
[troubleshooting](/platform/use-platform/troubleshooting)
section for assistance.
