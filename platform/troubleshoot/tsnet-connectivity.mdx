# Resolve vCluster TSNet connection failures

The [TSNet (Tailscale Network)](https://tailscale.com/kb/1244/tsnet) connection failure prevents the vCluster Platform from properly marking vClusters as ready, even when they are running successfully. When this occurs, TSNet cannot establish a stable connection with the platform, which blocks communication between the vCluster on the connected cluster and the platform. As a result, the vCluster appears it is running in the host cluster but shows as it is not ready in the platform UI, which prevents proper management and monitoring.

## Error message

You might find the following error in the logs of your vCluster pods when TSNet fails to connect:

```
ERROR ts-net-controller tsnet/tsnet.go:148 Check if TSNet is online { 
  "component": "vcluster", 
  "failCounter": 5, 
  "error": "vcluster tsnet server is not online: ... Tailscale could not connect to any relay server. ... The last login error was: register request: Post \"https://vcluster-test.io/coordinator/machine/register\": connection attempts aborted by context: context deadline exceeded"
}
```

## Issue

When the TSNet connection fails, you might observe the following:

- **vCluster status discrepancy**: The vCluster shows as `Running` in the remote host cluster but is not marked as ready in the vCluster Platform UI.

- **Successful local connection**: You can successfully connect to the vCluster using `vcluster connect` command.

- **Platform communication blocked**: The vCluster cannot communicate with the platform for status updates and management operations.

To verify TSNet connection issues, check the vCluster logs:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> logs <vcluster-pod> | grep -i "tsnet\|ts-net"
```

Look for errors related to connection timeouts or relay server failures.


## Causes

TSNet connection failures might occur due to the following:

- **Restricted egress policies**: Host clusters with strict network policies (common in GKE, EKS, and other managed Kubernetes services) might block outbound connections to the coordination server.

- **Ingress controller interference**: Ingress controllers like Istio might block or interfere with WebSocket upgrades required for TSNet communication.

- **Direct connection attempts**: TSNet defaults to attempting direct peer-to-peer connections, which often fail in cloud environments with network restrictions.

- **Firewall restrictions**: Corporate firewall rules or cloud security groups might block the required ports and protocols for TSNet communication.


## Solution

To resolve TSNet connection failures, disable direct connection mode and configure TSNet to use the platform agent for communication. This approach works better in restricted network environments.

<Flow id="Resolve TSNet connection failures">

<Step title="Configure TSNet to disable direct connections">

Configure TSNet to disable direct connections

Update your vCluster configuration to explicitly disable direct peer-to-peer connections:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    env:
      - name: "TS_DEBUG_DIAL_DIRECT"
        value: "false"
```
</Step>

<Step title="Apply the configuration">

Update your existing vCluster with the new configuration:

```bash
vcluster create <vcluster-name> -f vcluster.yaml --upgrade
```

Or if using Helm directly:

```bash
helm upgrade <vcluster-name> vcluster --repo https://charts.loft.sh -f vcluster.yaml -n <namespace>
```
</Step>

<Step title="Restart the vCluster pods">

Force a restart of the vCluster pods to ensure the new environment variable takes effect:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> rollout restart statefulset <vcluster-name>
```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify network connectivity">

Ensure the vCluster can reach the platform coordination server:

```bash
kubectl -n <namespace> exec -it <vcluster-pod> -- nslookup <your-platform-host>
```
</Step>
</Flow>

## Verification

After completing the solution steps:

<Flow>
<Step title="Check vCluster pod status">

  Ensure the vCluster pod is running in your namespace:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n <namespace> get pods | grep <vcluster-name>
  ```
</Step> 

<Step title="Verify TSNet connectivity"> 

  Check the pod logs for TSNet connection status:

  ```bash
  kubectl -n <namespace> logs <vcluster-pod> | grep -i "tsnet" | tail -10
  ```
</Step> 

<Step title="Confirm platform status"> 

  Open the vCluster Platform UI and confirm that the vCluster is marked as **Ready**. 

</Step> 

<Step title="Test vCluster"> 

  Connect to the virtual cluster and check node access:

  ```bash
  vcluster connect <vcluster-name> -n <namespace>
  kubectl get nodes
  ```
</Step>
</Flow> 

## Prevention

To prevent future TSNet connection issues, you can apply the following preventive measures in your vCluster configuration:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    env:
      - name: "TS_DEBUG_DIAL_DIRECT"
        value: "false"
      - name: "TS_DEBUG_NETCHECK"
        value: "true"
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "256Mi"
        cpu: "100m"
      limits:
        memory: "512Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

This configuration:
- Disables direct peer-to-peer connections
- Sets appropriate resource limits for stable operation


## Best practices

To ensure reliable TSNet connectivity in the platform:

- **Always disable direct connections**: Set `TS_DEBUG_DIAL_DIRECT=false` in environments to avoid connection issues.

- **Monitor network policies**: Ensure your host cluster's network policies allow outbound connections to the platform coordination server.

- **Configure appropriate timeouts**: Set reasonable timeout values for network operations in restricted environments.

- **Use resource limits**: Configure appropriate CPU and memory limits to prevent resource contention that could affect network connectivity.

- **Test connectivity during deployment**: Verify platform connectivity as part of your vCluster deployment process to catch issues early.
