## 1. Importing vCluster(s)

:::warning Existing vCluster
The following steps assume that you have existing Open-Source vClusters and you want to import and upgrade them to the Pro Distro.
If you want to import OSS vClusters without upgrading to the Pro Distro, use the `--disable-upgrade` flag. 
:::

Import your existing OSS vCluster to vCluster Platform using the following command:

```bash
vcluster import test-cluster --cluster "loft-cluster" --namespace vcluster-test-cluster --project "default"
```

Repeat the above step for all the vClusters you want to import to vCluster Platform.

A more extensive guide on importing vClusters can be found [here](/platform/virtual-clusters/import-vclusters.mdx).

## 2. Upgrading OSS vClusters to Pro

If you've already imported your OSS vClusters using the `--disable-upgrade` flag, and then you want to upgrade to Pro, follow these steps in the vCluster Platform UI to change the template of the vCluster to a `Virtual Cluster Pro Template`.

This can be done using the following steps:

<Flow id="upgrade-vcluster">
  <Step>
    Navigate to the vCluster overview by selecting <NavStep>Projects</NavStep>{" "}
    field on the left menu bar
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the <NavStep>Virtual Clusters</NavStep> field on the left menu bar
    below the project name.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Hover over the vCluster you want to upgrade and click on the{" "}
    <Button>Change Template</Button> button.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select a vCluster Pro template, by default there is one called `Virtual
    Cluster Pro Template` and click on <Button>Change Template</Button>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Once the template is changed, hover over the template name in the "Template"
    column and click on the <Button>Sync with Template</Button> button.
    (Alternatively <Button>Sync All in Project</Button> if importing & upgrading
    multiple vClusters)
  </Step>
</Flow>
