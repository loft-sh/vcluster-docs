# Overview
When a **vCluster Platform** is deployed on a host cluster (for example, **Cluster A**), it can act as a centralized control plane. Other host clusters can connect to the vCluster Platform running on Cluster A and be managed by it.

In this architecture:
- **Cluster A** runs the vCluster Platform.
- Other host clusters connect to Cluster A and run the vCluster Platform Agent.
- The Platform coordinates and manages all connected host clusters through their agents.

## Installation Modes

Both **vCluster Platform** and **vCluster Platform Agent** are installed using the same Helm chart: `vcluster-platform`. The installation mode is controlled by the `agentOnly` value:
```yaml
agentOnly: false
# Installs the vCluster Platform (control plane).
agentOnly: true
# Installs the vCluster Platform Agent.
```

## Install on the primary host cluster

When installing the vCluster Platform on the primary host cluster (for example, Cluster A), set `agentOnly: false` and optionally configure `agentValues`.
For example:
```yaml
agentOnly: false
agentValues: {}
```
The `agentValues` behavior is as follows:
- By default, `agentValues` is an empty list `{}`.
- An empty `agentValues` list means that agents installed on connected host clusters will inherit the same configuration as the platform running on Cluster A.
- You can populate `agentValues` to override the default agent configuration globally for all connected host clusters.

Notice that this is also installing an agent on the primary host cluster. Both vCluster Platform and vCluster Platform Agent will be running on the primary host cluster.
vCluster Platform manage the primary host cluster through the vCluster Platform Agent as well.
