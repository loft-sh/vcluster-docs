Modify the platform's behavior and enable or turn off certain features, such as SSO login, custom branding, or auditing.

## Changing the platform config

The platform config can be applied directly via helm values or through the UI in `Admin > Config`. Using helm values allows you to declaratively deploy the platform.

When using helm, you can apply the platform config via a
values.yaml file. This
also makes it possible to deploy the platform through [GitOps
solutions](../install/gitops) such as ArgoCD. An example platform `values.yaml` could look like this:

```yaml title="Example vCluster Platform configuration"
config:
  loftHost: my-vcluster-host.com
  audit:
    enabled: true
  auth:
    github:
      clientId: $CLIENT_ID
      clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
      redirectURI: https://my-vcluster-host.com/auth/github/callback
```

For a complete overview of possible Helm values, please refer to the [values.yaml](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/blob/master/chart/values.yaml).

### Changing the `loftHost` variable

After setting up the platform, TLS certificates, and configuring the ingress to
use a [custom domain](./domain.mdx), you need to change the `loftHost` variable.
Initially, that value is set to the URL of either the Loft Router domain or no
domain in the case of [air-gapped](../install/advanced/air-gapped.mdx) setups. This value should be equal to the hostname specified in the ingress resource for accessing the platform.

:::info
The value of the `loftHost` variable should only be the hostname that the platform is reachable at and not contain protocols (such as HTTP) or subpaths.
:::

After changing the `loftHost`, all currently connected clusters must be redeployed by running the same connection commands in the corresponding Kubernetes context. See the instructions [on connecting clusters](../administer/clusters/connect-cluster.mdx) for more guidance.

Clusters must also be reconnected if the `additionalCA` or `insecureSkipVerify` values are changed after the initial setup.

### Sensitive information in the platform config

Some fields within the platform config allow placeholders for environment variables, such as the `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields. This makes it possible to not expose sensitive information directly inside the platform values and instead mount this information into the platform through an external secret.

To load the GitHub `clientId` and `clientSecret` through a Kubernetes secret `my-secret`, use the following configuration:

```yaml title="Configuration with sensitive information"
envValueFrom:
  CLIENT_ID:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: my-secret
      key: client_id
  CLIENT_SECRET:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: my-secret
      key: client_secret

config:
  auth:
    github:
      clientId: $CLIENT_ID
      clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
      redirectURI: https://my-vcluster-platform-host.com/auth/github/callback
```

Then use Helm to apply this configuration and update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid platform version.

```bash title="Apply configuration using Helm"
helm upgrade loft vcluster-platform --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values.yaml \
  --version $PLATFORM_VERSION
```

<!-- vale off -->
### Custom HTTP headers
<!-- vale on -->
The platform allows you to add custom HTTP headers to all requests that are sent to the platform API. This can be useful if you want to add custom headers to all requests, such as `X-Frame-Options` or `X-XSS-Protection`.

To add custom HTTP headers, use the following configuration:

```yaml title="Custom HTTP headers configuration"
config:
  auth:
    customHttpHeaders:
      X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
      X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

### Setting additional certificate authority for platform

If you want to have **all** your virtual clusters managed by the platform use a
specific certificate authority to establish the connection between the virtual
cluster and the platform, you can set it as a configuration option on the
platform instead of configuring it on each individual virtual cluster. This
enables secure communication between your virtual clusters and the platform.

As a prerequisite, you have to [configure TLS for the platform](/platform/configure/domain#configure-tls) first.

```yaml title="Additional certificate authority configuration"
additionalCA: "(base64 encoded CA)"
```

If you need to import externally managed virtual clusters to the platform, you can also enable a secure connection by grabbing the value from the existing platform. You can do this by running:

```bash title="Get additionalCA value"
helm get values --namespace [namespace where vCluster Platform is deployed] [loft helm release name] --all | grep additionalCA
```

Using the `additionalCA` value from the preceding command, import the vCluster using the following vCluster CLI command:

```bash title="Import vCluster with additionalCA"
vcluster platform add vcluster <VCLUSTER_NAME> \
--namespace=<VCLUSTER_NAMESPACE> \
--project=<PROJECT_NAME> \
--ca-data [base64 string grabbed from the command above]
```

Once the command succeeds, the imported vCluster pod restarts and reports `Ready`.

### The platform agent

Every connected cluster in a platform environment, including the "main" cluster
that platform is deployed in, must have a platform Agent deployed. This agent
pod handles reconciliation of cluster-scoped (as in not platform instance-wide) resources.

By default, when the platform is installed, the platform pod also installs the
platform Agent into the cluster you are deploying platform into. This is usually
a desirable behavior since the platform requires the Agent to be present in all
clusters. Sometimes, however, admins wish to manage the installation of the
platform Agent themselves, either by installing it explicitly or by
installing it via GitOps tooling. In this situation, it is possible to turn off the Agent deployment by setting the `DISABLE_AGENT` environment variable to "true". This can be accomplished in the `env` section of the platform values:

```yaml title="Disable Agent deployment"
env:
  DISABLE_AGENT: true
```

It is also possible to tell platform not to install Agents into individual
clusters. This can be accomplished by setting the `loft.sh/cluster-ignore-agent`
Annotation of the Cluster resource to "true" for any clusters that the platform should not manage the Agent deployment on.

:::warning platform Agent is required
The platform Agent is required for every connected cluster in a platform
deployment, including the cluster platform itself is deployed into. If you are
disabling the agent deployment via one of the mechanisms described preceding, make sure you are still getting an Agent installed into every connected cluster by some other means.
:::

If you are electing to manage the Agent installation yourself, you can install the Agent directly using Helm. Update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid platform version.

```bash title="Install Agent using Helm"
helm upgrade vcluster-platform vcluster-platform --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace \
  --set agentOnly=true \
  --version $PLATFORM_VERSION
```

### Platform agent values

As with the primary platform chart, the platform Agent chart exposes values that can be configured by an administrator to suit their needs. The Agent chart and values can be seen in the public repository [here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart).

If you have deployed the platform with the default behavior of not disabling the Agent deployment, you can still provide values to influence the deployment of the Agent itself. This can be accomplished by providing any valid Agent values in the `agentValues` section of the platform chart values. These values are received by the platform deployment and used when deploying the Agent pods. Below is an example of the platform values `agentValues` section.

```yaml title="Agent values configuration"
agentValues:
  securityContext:
    enabled: true
```

Administrators can also provide Agent values for specific clusters by setting the `loft.sh/agent-values` Annotation of a specific cluster object. These values always override any values provided in the parent platform chart.
