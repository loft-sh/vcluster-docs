---

The platform UI can be customized to match your corporate design, enhancing brand consistency and user experience.

Custom branding can be configured using the [platform config](../api/resources/config.mdx). Add the following YAML configuration to your platform config file:

```yaml title="Basic custom branding configuration"
uiSettings:
  # Terms of Service, Privacy Policy etc.
  # Can be an html string.
  legalTemplate: You agree to the <a href="http://acme.com/">Terms of Service</a>

  # An **accessible** url. Can be in your cluster as long as you make sure the UI can find it
  logoURL: https://acme.com/static/our-logo.svg

  # Primary color
  # Can be `hex`, `rgb` or `rgba` string
  primaryColor: "#1890ff"

  # Sidebar color
  # Can be `hex`, `rgb` or `rgba` string
  sidebarColor: "#001529"

  # Accent color
  # Can be `hex`, `rgb` or `rgba` string
  accentColor: "#00BDFF"
```

## Advanced custom branding

For more extensive customization, you can add custom navigation items and apply additional CSS and JavaScript.

### Custom navigation items

Extend the primary sidebar with your own navigation items:

```yaml title="Adding custom navigation items"
navBarButtons:
  - text: "My Link"
    icon: "https://acme.com/static/my-icon.svg"
    link: "https://acme.com/my-link"
    position: TopEnd # Options: TopStart, TopEnd, BottomStart, BottomEnd (default: BottomEnd)
```

### Custom CSS and JavaScript

For more control over the UI appearance and behavior, you can include custom CSS and JavaScript files:

```yaml title="Including custom CSS and JavaScript"
customCss:
  - https://your-server.tld/overrides.css
customJavaScript:
  - https://your-server.tld/script.js
```

:::info
Ensure that all custom files (CSS, JavaScript, and images) are accessible to the platform UI. The CSS classes and HTML IDs in the platform UI DOM are stable across versions, allowing for consistent styling and scripting.
