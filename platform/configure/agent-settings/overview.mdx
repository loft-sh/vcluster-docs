# Overview
When a **vCluster Platform** is deployed on a host cluster (or, primary host cluster), it can act as a centralized control plane. Other host clusters can connect to the vCluster Platform running on the primary host cluster and be managed by it. In this architecture:
- The primary host cluster runs the vCluster Platform.
- Other host clusters connect to the primary host cluster and run the vCluster Platform Agent.
- The Platform coordinates and manages all connected host clusters through their agents.
- There are both vCluster Platform and vCluster Platform agent running on the primary host cluster . The vCluster Platform manages the primary host cluster through its vCluster Platform Agent as well.

Agent settings are the content in the [`values.yaml`](../introduction.mdx) under the `agentValues`. It controls the behaviour of vCluster Platform Agents installed in the host clusters 
that are managed by the vCluster Platform.

The `agentValues` behavior is as follows:
- By default, `agentValues` is an empty list `{}`.
- An empty `agentValues` list means that agents installed on connected host clusters will inherit the same configuration as the platform running on the primary host cluster.
- You can populate `agentValues` to override the default agent configuration globally for all connected host clusters.

## Customize agent per host cluster

As described [here](../installation-options/overview#installation-modes), the vCluster Platform Agent can be installed using the same `vcluster-platform` chart by setting `agentOnly: true`. And the configuration of 
the agent by default will be decided by the configuration of the platform in the primary host cluster and the `agentValues` content.

However, this means that all host clusters connecting to the platform will share the same configuration. If different connected host clusters require different agent configurations, there are two supported approaches.

1. Add the `loft.sh/agent-values` annotation to a specific Cluster resource (via the UI or YAML). This annotation overrides the platform-level `agentValues`. The override applies only to the annotated Cluster. For example:
  ```yaml
  loft.sh/agent-values: |
    replicaCount: 2
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 2Gi
  ```
2. When installing the agent directly on a host cluster, you can override values by passing a custom values file to Helm. But first, you should tell vCluster Platform to ignore the agent of the specific cluster by adding annotation:
  ```
  kubectl annotate cluster cluster-B loft.sh/cluster-ignore-agent="true"
  ```
  Then you can set the values through the `--values` flag:
  ```bash
  helm install vcluster-platform vcluster-platform \
    --set agentOnly=true \
    --values custom-values.yaml
  ```
  This approach allows full control over agent configuration at installation time for that specific host cluster.

## Retrieve agent values

For a platform instance on host `nimbus.vcluster.cloud` with a connected cluster named `staging`, the following table shows how to retrieve agent values for each tier. Use these endpoints to determine current agent configuration or to layer values instead of overriding them.

You can specify multiple values files:
```bash
--values=https://<platform-config-endpoint> --values=https://<cluster-annotation-endpoint>
```
An [access key](/platform/administer/users-permissions/access-keys#how-access-keys-work) is required for authentication.
