## Platform-managed agents

Platform-managed agents automatically receive upgrades controlled by the control plane.
These automatic upgrades also handle more significant agent changes and migrations.
All agents connect using an egress-only connection to the platform.

### Upgrade process

When the platform initiates an upgrade on an egress-only agent, it will first deploy a proxy-only agent.
As the name suggests, this proxy-only agent solely aims to proxy the communication between the platform and the connected cluster's Kubernetes API server.

The platform deploys the proxy-only agent by creating a deployment in the connected cluster's agent's namespace. It additionally reuses the agent's service account and associated RBAC permissions.
Once the proxy-only agent is healthy, the platform upgrades the agent deployment.
In case of a failure during the upgrade, the platform can still connect via the proxy-only agent and perform a rollback to a previous agent version.

When the platform starts the agent upgrade, the agent will be unavailable for a brief period until it restarts and reconnects. This proxy-only agent maintains a connection to the connected cluster's Kubernetes apiserver during that upgrade period and serves as a backup connection.

<DuringSvg2 width="100%" />

The proxy-only agent exists for the entire duration of the upgrade process, and the platform uses it to communicate with the connected cluster's Kubernetes API server.
By doing so, the platform ensures that the connected cluster remains operational and can continue to receive updates and perform operations.

Once the agent upgrade is complete, the platform will remove the proxy-only agent and the associated resources from the connected cluster.

## Self-managed agents

If the platform does not manage your agents, manually upgrade them by repeating the installation steps using the CLI or Helm command.
Instructions on how to do can be found [here](overview#connect-to-platform).

## Disable agent upgrades

There might be cases where you don't want vCluster Platform to automatically handle vCluster Platform agent updates. This can be achieved either by setting the environment variable `DISABLE_AGENT` to `true` in the vCluster Platform container or by setting the annotation `loft.sh/cluster-ignore-agent: 'true'` on a connected cluster.

Or you can finish this in vCluster Platform UI:

<Flow id="cluster-disable-vcluster-platform-agent">
  <Step>
    Go to the <NavStep>Clusters</NavStep> view using the menu on the left.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the drop down arrow next to the cluster name you wish to modify. In
    the drop down menu click the <Label>Edit</Label> button.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the drawer that appears from the right, click the <Label>Agent</Label>{" "}
    configuration pane and select the 'Ignore Agent' checkbox.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the <Button>Save Changes</Button> button.
  </Step>
</Flow>

:::warning
If you do not install vCluster Platform agent into a connected cluster at all, certain capability, such as Spaces, <GlossaryTerm term="sleep">Auto Sleep</GlossaryTerm>, Apps, Accounts, Account Quotas & Security Templates will not be available in the cluster
