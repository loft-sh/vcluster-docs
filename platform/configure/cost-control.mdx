import VersionBadge from '@site/src/components/VersionBadge';

The platform comes with the cost control dashboard enabled by default, offering insights into potential [cost savings](https://www.vcluster.com/cost-savings) through virtual clusters.

<VersionBadge platformVersion="v4.2.0" vclusterVersion="v0.22.0"/>

To track allocations and calculate savings for workloads running inside
virtual clusters the platform deploys and manages [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and
[OpenCost](https://www.opencost.io/) on each connected cluster. Prometheus uses a time series database that requires
persistent volume storage to retain metrics over time. The platform-managed
Prometheus is configured to collect the minimum metrics required for the cost
control dashboard. OpenCost provides CPU, GPU, and Memory allocation metrics for the
deployed workloads.

In addition to the Prometheus instance on the connected cluster, the cluster
hosting the platform has a global Prometheus
installed that is configured to aggregate metrics from all connected clusters. This utilizes the connected cluster private
network so no additional networking configuration is required.

:::warning Storage requirements
By default, the Cost Control Dashboard requests
60Gi persistent volumes for each connected cluster's metrics, and an additional
60Gi persistent volume for global metric aggregation. See the
[Configuration](#configuration) section for details on enabling/disabling the
dashboard or configuring its resource needs.
:::

:::warning Network requirements
In air-gapped or private GKE clusters it may be necessary to add a firewall rule allowing
incoming traffic to port `9090`. This port is used when aggregating metrics from
connected clusters.
:::

## Configuration

Although the platform manages Prometheus and OpenCost automatically, certain
settings can be configured to better suit specific environments or needs. The
primary configuration is part of the [platform `constControl`
config](/platform/configure/cost-control).


To turn off the cost control dashboard, which is enabled by default, set `costControl.enabled` to `false`:

```yaml title="Turning off the Cost Control Dashboard"
config:
  costControl:
    enabled: false
```

The remaining configuration customizes the cost settings, global Prometheus, and connected cluster OpenCost and Prometheus. These are detailed in the following sections.

### Cost settings

The platform provides initial cost defaults as shown below. These can be customized for your environment.
```yaml title="Default Cost Settings"
config:
  costControl:
    settings:
      # Average CPU cost
      averageCPUPricePerNode:
        price: 31
        timePeriod: Monthly
      # Average Memory cost
      averageRAMPricePerNode:
        price: 31
        timePeriod: Monthly
      # Average GPU cost
      averageGPUPricePerNode:
        price: 31
        timePeriod: Monthly
      # Monthly or Yearly cost for Hosted Control Planes
      controlPlanePricePerCluster:
        price: 900
        timePeriod: Yearly
```

### Global observability

These settings control, the global Prometheus's availability, retention,
storage, cpu, and memory configuration. The
default settings are provided below for reference, and may be customized.

```yaml title="Default Global Prometheus Settings"
config:
  costControl:
    global:
      metrics:
        # Number of replicas for the Prometheus Deployment
        replicas: 1
        # Prometheus TSDB retention settings: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects
        retention: 1y
        # CPU and Memory Requests and Limits for the Prometheus Deployment
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 6Gi
          limits:
            cpu: '2'
            memory: 6Gi
        # Storage Settings for Persistent Volumes
        storage:
          size: 60Gi
          # Valid values:
          # - null:  use the default storage class
          # - "": disable automatic storage provisioning
          # - name of the preferred configured storage class
          storageClass: null
```

`retention` refers to Prometheus's TSDB retention settings. Details regarding valid units can be found in the
[prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects)

`storageClass` configures the storage class that should be used for provisioning of the Prometheus deployment's
`StatefulSet`. Valid values are:
- `null`: use the cluster's default storage class
- `""` (empty string): turn off automatic provisioning
- The name of a pre-configured storage class on the cluster

:::warning Overriding Resources
Overridden `resources` are not merged with the defaults to avoid unexpected changes from Helm charts used by the
platform to manage Prometheus. Therefore, all requests and limits that you wish to apply should be provided.
:::

### Cluster observability

These settings control the Prometheus's configuration for each connected
cluster. These are applied uniformly
across multiple clusters, but can be customized using [Cluster Specific Configuration](#other-cluster-settings).

```yaml title="Default Cluster Prometheus Settings"
config:
  costControl:
    cluster:
      metrics:
        # Number of replicas for the Prometheus Deployment
        replicas: 1
        # Prometheus TSDB retention settings: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#operational-aspects
        retention: 1y
        # CPU and Memory Requests and Limits for the Prometheus Deployment
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 3Gi
          limits:
            cpu: '1'
            memory: 3Gi
        # Storage Settings for Persistent Volumes
        storage:
          size: 60Gi
          # Valid values:
          # - null:  use the default storage class
          # - "": disable automatic storage provisioning
          # - name of the preferred configured storage class
          storageClass: null
```

:::warning Overriding Resources
Overridden `resources` are not merged with the defaults to avoid unexpected changes from Helm charts used by the
platform to manage Prometheus. Therefore, all requests and limits that you wish to apply should be provided.

### Cluster cost control

These settings control the OpenCost deployment on each connected cluster. While there are many possible ways to
configure OpenCost, the Platform configures it with the minimum settings required for the dashboard. As such only
availability, CPU, and memory settings may be configured.

```yaml title="Default OpenCost Settings"
config:
  costControl:
    cluster:
      opencost:
        # Number of replicas for the OpenCost Deployment
        replicas: 1
        # CPU and Memory Requests and Limits for the OpenCost Deployment
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 3Gi
          limits:
            cpu: '1'
            memory: 3Gi
```

:::warning Overriding Resources
Overridden `resources` are not merged with the defaults to avoid unexpected changes from Helm charts used by the

### Other cluster settings

For individual cluster configuration, the [Cluster](/platform/api/resources/clusters) resource allows for further
configuration specific to each cluster.
