## What are Users and Teams?

Users and teams are entities that can interact with the vCluster Platform API. A user can
be a developer that develops applications or an administrator that manages the
vCluster Platform platform. Users can be assigned to teams, which set the permissions applied
to all the team's members. For example, you can give virtual cluster access to a team, which
gives all members of the team virtual cluster access.
