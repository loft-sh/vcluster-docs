To use vCluster Platform CLI as the impersonated user, you can run the following command while impersonation is active:

```bash
vcluster pro login localhost:9898 --insecure    # or use your loft.domain.tld instead of localhost, and ideally with a valid SSL cert and without the --insecure flag
```

You can verify the login and print your user information via:

```bash
vcluster pro login
```
