# What is vCluster-platform communication?

Several background processes run when creating a vCluster that enable communication with the platform. 

## Components in vCluster-platform communication

### The platform
The control center for managing your virtual clusters. This includes the main dashboard where you can view, configure, and monitor all your virtual clusters.

### vCluster
Your virtual Kubernetes cluster that runs your applications. It connects securely to the platform.

### Access key
Your unique pass for connecting a vCluster to the platform. It ensures only your authorized clusters can communicate with your platform.

### VPN tunnel
A secure, private connection that keeps your cluster communication safe and protected.


## What is a VPN Tunnel?

A VPN tunnel creates a secure connection between endpoints and the internet that protects your data. It safeguards your privacy and reduces the risk of hackers intercepting your information.

## What is VPN Mesh?

A VPN mesh forms a secure, decentralized network where devices connect directly to each other using encrypted tunnels. In cluster architecture, VPN mesh (Tailscale) secures communication between the vCluster platform and virtual clusters.

## Register vCluster on the platform

Regardless of platform deployment (same cluster as vCluster, separate management cluster, or vCluster cloud), the platform and API serve as key communication components.

The vCluster initiates communication with the platform by providing its access key. After receiving the access key, the platform registers and validates the vCluster.

A bi-directional VPN tunnel then establishes secure communication between the platform and the vCluster. This approach works with all types of load balancers.

## Platform configuration

Administrators can configure the endpoint and access key for the platform using Helm values.
