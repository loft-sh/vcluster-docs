Upgrading vCluster Platform is easy! vCluster Platform can be upgraded either via the vCluster CLI, or with Helm.

<PartialAdminUpgrade />

:::info Versions and Values
The `$VERSION` variable above is an environment variable set to your desired vCluster Platform version to
deploy. The `vcluster-platform.yaml` file is an optional YAML file that contains Helm values you would like
to use when upgrading your vCluster Platform deployment.
:::

## Upgrading from v3.x to v4.0

:::info Upgrade to latest v3 first
Before attempting to perform this major upgrade please ensure that you have upgraded to the latest v3 release first. E.g. by running the steps above.
:::

:::warning Only vCluster CLI is supported
If you choose to upgrade vCluster Platform via the CLI it is required to use the `vcluster` CLI and not the `loft` CLI. For further information
please see the [Loft CLI to vCluster CLI Migration section](/vcluster/reference/migrations/loft-cli-vcluster-cli-migration/).
:::

With v4.0 the project namespace prefix can now be configured and the default has been changed from `loft-p` (which is used by v3) to `p-`.
In order for the upgrade from v3 to v4 to succeed you must set this explicitly regardless of updating via the vCluster CLI or via Helm.

<PartialAdminUpgradeV3V4 />

If you accidentially performed the upgrade without setting the `projectNamespacePrefix` to the above mentioned value the vCluster platform Pod will be in a CrashLoopBackoff showing a log similiar to:

```bash
cmd/main.go:107 error executing root command    {"component": "loft", "error": "init (4): set default project namespace prefix: seems like you have upgraded the platform from an earlier version that uses 'loft-p-' as a project namespace prefix. This has been changed to be 'p-' in the current version. Please set 'projectNamespacePrefix: loft-p-' in the platform config to get rid of this error"}
```

In that case wait until the Pod starts up again and retry the above upgrade command by passing along a vcluster-platform.yaml file that contains the config change.
