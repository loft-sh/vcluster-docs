vCluster Platform can act as an OpenID Connect provider for other services, e.g. a self-hosted container registry using [Harbor](https://goharbor.io).

## Configuring vCluster Platform as an OIDC Provider

To tell vCluster Platform to act as OIDC provider, navigate to `Admin > Config` and add the `oidc` section to your config:

```yaml {2-9}
auth: ...
oidc:
  enabled: true
  clients:
    - name: "Example Client"
      clientId: "loft"
      clientSecret: "MYCLIENTSECRET"
      redirectURIs:
        - http://my-allowed-redirect-uri
# - ADD A 2nd OIDC CLIENT HERE
# - ADD A 3rd OIDC CLIENT HERE
```

## Adding OIDC Clients to vCluster Platform OIDC Using Secrets

You can add OIDC clients to vCluster Platform using Kubernetes secrets. These secrets should contain the string fields `name`, `clientID`, `clientSecret`, and `redirectURIs`. Multiple redirect URIs should be delimitted by `\n`. vCluster Platform will only recognize an OIDC client secret if they posses the labels `clientID` and `component`. The value for `clientID` should match the `clientID` field's value and the value for `component` should be `oidcServer`. Here is an example of a yaml manifest that can be used to manage an OIDC client for vCluster Platform's OIDC provider:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: test-oidc-client
  namespace: vcluster-platform # Namespace where vCluster Platform is installed
  labels:
    clientID: loft2
    component: oidcServer
type: Opaque
stringData:
  name: "Example Client"
  clientID: "loft2"
  clientSecret: "MYCLIENTSECRET"
  redirectURIs: http://my-allowed-redirect-uri\nhttp://my-allowed-redirect-uri2 # delimit multiple uris with newlines
```

## Using vCluster OIDC Provider in Other Applications

To configure vCluster Platform as an OIDC provider somewhere else, you can fill out the following fields with:

- OIDC Provider Endpoint / Issuer: https://vcluster-platform.mycompany.tld/oidc
- OIDC Client ID: loft
- OIDC Client Secret: MYCLIENTSECRET
- Group Claim Name: groups
- Available OIDC Scopes: offline_access,openid,groups,email,profile

With this configuration, your vCluster Platform users will be able to authenticate in another application using their vCluster Platform account (which may itself be based on another SSO provider).
