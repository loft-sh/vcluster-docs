In vCluster Platform, typically, virtual clusters are accessed via the vCluster Platform proxy, that is, requests to the
virtual cluster API server, are proxied through vCluster Platform itself. This behavior allows for vCluster Platform to
act as a single endpoint for all virtual clusters in the vCluster Platform deployment. Because of this
behavior, vCluster Platform is also able to act as a central point of authentication and authorization, and
to log all interactions (if vCluster Platform Auditing is licensed and enabled).

In some situations you may prefer to access a virtual cluster API server directly, that is, not
via the vCluster Platform proxy. This behavior can be enabled with the virtual cluster 'AccessPoint' feature.
Enabling 'AccessPoint' on a virtual cluster requires that the host cluster has a valid ingress
controller deployed, and the 'Cluster' object has the `loft.sh/ingress-suffix` annotation set
with a valid domain.

The hostname used to access a virtual cluster that has the 'AccessPoint' feature enabled, will
be of the following format:

`[VirtualClusterInstance Name]-[Project Name].[ingressSuffix]`

Where the `VirtualClusterInstance Name` is the name of the virtual cluster instance, the
`Project Name` is the name of the project the virtual cluster instance is created in, and the
`ingressSuffix` is the value from the Cluster `loft.sh/ingress-suffix` annotation.

Enabling the 'AccessPoint' feature can be done during virtual cluster instance creation in the
vCluster Platform UI.
