This example shows how to create and reuse a virtual cluster for testing an application named `my-app` on pull requests.

```yaml {21}
# .github/workflows/vclusters.yaml
name: Pull Request Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - "main"
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install vCluster CLI
        uses: loft-sh/setup-vcluster@main
      - name: Login to vCluster Platform instance
        env:
          LOFT_URL: ${{ secrets.LOFT_URL }}
          ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_KEY }}
        run: vcluster login $LOFT_URL --access-key $ACCESS_KEY
      - name: Create PR Virtual Cluster
        env:
          NAME: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
        run: vcluster create $NAME --project default --upgrade
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
      - name: Wait for Deployment
        run: kubectl rollout status deployments/my-app
      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
```

**Explanation:**

1. The [Setup vCluster Platform](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-vcluster) action is used to install the vCluster CLI.
2. The `vcluster login` command is used to log in to the organization's vCluster Platform instance. Environment variables `LOFT_URL` and `ACCESS_KEY` are populated using [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
3. The `vcluster create` command is used to create a unique virtual cluster using information about the pull request in the `default` project. This will automatically configure the kube context for the next steps. The `--upgrade` flag has been added to reuse the existing virtual cluster and upgrade it to the latest version. Additional flags may be used to control the desired virtual cluster version.
4. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
5. Before running tests, we use `kubectl` to wait for the `my-app` deployment to become ready.
6. Now we run the end-to-end tests. In this example we're using `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework.
