The Rancher integration creates a seamless experience that enables self-service virtual cluster creation and management for teams already using Rancher to manage their Kubernetes fleet. Now you can provision and manage the entire lifecycle of virtual clusters in Rancher the same way you would any traditional Kubernetes cluster.

The Rancher integration enables organizations to:
- Unify management of virtual clusters and regular clusters within Rancher.
- Enable virtual cluster self-service for Rancher users within guardrails defined by Rancher admins.
- Continue using Rancher for user management while syncing permissions between Rancher and vCluster Platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A running vCluster Platform
- A running Rancher Server
- A [Rancher API Bearer Token](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/api/quickstart) to allow vCluster Platform to access and perform actions in Rancher


:::info Bearer Token
The Bearer Token to be used should have a long expiration or must be rotated using an external mechanism as it will be used for every call to the Rancher API
:::

## Install the vCluster Platform extension in Rancher

<Flow id="install-rancher-plugin">
  <Step>
    In the Rancher UI, click on the <NavStep>Extensions</NavStep> in the left side menu. Click on the ellipsis menu on the top right and select <Label>Manage Repositories</Label>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on <Button>Create</Button> on the right. Give the repository a name and enter <Label>https://charts.loft.sh/</Label> as the Index URL.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on <Button>Create</Button> at the bottom.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Navigate back to the <NavStep>Extensions</NavStep> page and click on <Label>Available</Label> tab. Click <Button>Install</Button> on the extension named <b>vCluster Platform</b>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Now we'll add a label on the Rancher management cluster resource <code>management.cattle.io/v1 group</code>. In the left side nav menu, click on the <Label>Cluster Management</Label> link and then click the on the ellipsis button of the management cluster where Rancher is installed and then select the <Label>Edit Config</Label> option.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Label>Labels & Annotations</Label> row and click on <Button>Add Label</Button>. Finally, add <code>loft.sh/loft-hostname</code> for the label's key and your Platform hostname without the protocal prefix, for example, my-vcluster-platform.dev
  </Step>
</Flow>

## Configure vCluster Platform 
Update the [configuration](../../api/resources/config) for vCluster Platform to add the Rancher object in order to enable the integration between vCluster Platform and Rancher. Adding it to the configuration with the bearer token enables vCluster Platform to communicate with Rancher via its API and perform the necessary actions required for syncing. This integration also enables SSO, so you can login to vCluster Platform via Rancher.
<Flow id="rancher-global-setup">
  <Step>
    Log in to vCluster Platform as an admin user and navigate to the <NavStep>Admin</NavStep> section in the leftside menu.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Edit the configuration by adding the Rancher object with the following
    properties:

  <Tabs defaultValue="token_inline" values={[
    { label: "Inline Rancher Token", value: "token_inline" },
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="token_inline">

    ```yaml
    auth:
      rancher:
        host: <RANCHER_SERVER_URL>
        bearerToken: "<RANCHER_BEARER_TOKEN>"
        insecure: <true/false>
    ```

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>


:::note Update the options with your Rancher server

Replace `<RANCHER_SERVER_URL>` with the address of your Rancher instance without the protocol prefix, for example, my-rancher.demo.dev

Replace `"<RANCHER_BEARER_TOKEN>"` with the Bearer Token that was created in Rancher. The bearer token is typically *Access Key: Secret Key* for example, `"token-28kg6:gl5nqsq2hmxmdxr7fvcpfz2hh2krzvqff5w78kxr4tvc6r6x6s67t4"`.

  </Step>
  <Step>Save the changes to the configuration by clicking <Button>Apply</Button> and wait for the platform to restart.</Step>
