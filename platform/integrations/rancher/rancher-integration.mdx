Deploying a virtual cluster (vCluster) in Rancher is similar to setting up any other Kubernetes cluster. The vCluster Rancher Operator helps by automatically creating a matching Rancher cluster for each vCluster, so you don't have to do it manually. Rancher users can deploy vClusters without requiring cluster management permissions, as the operator handles the necessary configurations. Additionally, project owners, project members of the virtual cluster's project, and the cluster owner are automatically assigned as cluster owners in the new Rancher cluster.

After configuring Rancher within the vCluster Platform, you can import virtual clusters into Rancher and manage them as standard clusters. To enable this integration for each virtual cluster, first activate the Rancher integration at the project level within the vCluster Platform.

  ## Develop and Deploy the vCluster Rancher Operator
  
  This section outlines how to develop and deploy the vCluster Rancher Operator using DevSpace and Helm. These instructions are intended for contributors or advanced users customizing the operator.
  
  ### Deploy with DevSpace
  
  This is the preferred workflow for local development.
  
  ```bash
  devspace dev
  ````
  
  ### Build and push a custom image
  
  Build and push your image to the specified registry:
  
  ```bash
  make docker-build docker-push IMG=<your-registry>/vcluster-rancher-operator:<tag>
  ```
  - Replace `<your-registry>` and `<tag>` with your container registry path and desired version tag.
  
  ### Deploy with Helm
  
  #### Basic Helm deployment
  
  Install the operator using Helm with your kubeconfig file:
  
  ```bash
  KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig.yaml helm install chart --generate-name --create-namespace
  ```
  
  #### Helm deployment with a custom Iimage
  
  Specify a custom registry, repository, and tag:
  
  ```bash
  KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig.yaml helm install chart --generate-name --create-namespace \
    --set image.registry=<REGISTRY> \
    --set image.repository=<REPO/REPO> \
    --set image.tag=<TAG>
  ```
  
  ### Update RBAC configuration
  
  If you make changes to controller roles, update the manifests as follows:
  
  1. Modify the `controller-gen` tags in `controller/cluster-controller.go`.
  2. Regenerate RBAC manifests:
  
  ```bash
  make manifests
  ```

  ### DevSpace Uninstall
  
  ```bash
  devspace purge
  rm -rf .devspace/*
  ```
  
  ### Helm Uninstall
  
  ```bash
  helm delete <release-name>
  ```
  
  Replace `<release-name>` with the name of your Helm release.
</details> 

### Prerequisites

- Docker is installed. 
- DevSpace for deploying and managing applications. 
- Rancher installed.
- Access to a local Kubernetes cluster within Rancher.

### Install 

Before being able to enable virtual clusters with the Rancher integration, it must be enabled on the project. When vCluster Platform projects are enabled with Rancher integration, a label `loft.sh/loft-project-name: <VCLUSTER_PLATFORM_PROJECT_NAME>` is added to the Rancher project resource. 

To install the vCluster Rancher Operator using the Rancher UI:

<Flow id="vcluster-rancher-operator-install">

  <Step>
  In the Rancher UI, navigate to the clusters overview page and select the **local** cluster.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  In the sidebar, go to **Apps** ‚Üí **Repositories**.
  Click **Create**, set a name (for example `loft-charts`), and enter the **Index URL**:
  `https://charts.loft.sh`
  </Step>

  <Step>
  **Optional**: Click the user icon in the top-right corner, select **Preferences** and enable **Include Prerelease Versions**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  Navigate to **Apps** ‚Üí **Charts**.
  Search for **vCluster Rancher Operator**, select it, and follow the installation prompts.
  </Step>

  <Step>
  After installation, navigate to **Workloads** ‚Üí **Deployments**.
  Ensure that the deployment named `vcluster-rancher-operator` has the state **Active**.
  </Step>

</Flow>

After it is installed, the vCluster Rancher Operator automatically integrates vCluster deployments with Rancher.

## Manage virtual clusters in the Rancher UI

### Create a virtual cluster in the Rancher UI

<Flow id="rancher-plugin-create-vcluster">
  <Step>
    In the Rancher home page, click **Create Virtual Cluster**.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter a name for the virtual cluster and select the Rancher project in which you wish to create the virtual cluster. Only those projects which have the Rancher Integration enabled are displayed in the list.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Create** which takes you to the <Label>Create VirtualClusterInstance</Label> page in the vCluster Platform to get ready to create a virtual cluster.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the <Label>Rancher</Label> configuration tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Slide the <Label>Add to Rancher</Label> toggle to enable.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Create** after you have configured the rest of the virtual cluster based on your preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step>
   In the Rancher UI, navigate to **‚ò∞ > Cluster Management**, locate your virtual cluster in the list, and confirm that its status is labeled as **Active**.

<Flow id="rancher-plugin-delete-vcluster">
  <Step>
    In the Rancher home page, click the **Delete** icon for the virtual cluster you want to delete.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    You are redirected to the **VirtualClusterInstance** Page in vCluster Platform for confirmation.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click **Delete** to confirm in the platform UI. The virtual cluster is then deleted from Rancher.
  </Step>
</Flow>

## Import virtual clusters into Rancher through vCluster Platform UI

Once a vCluster Platform project has the Rancher integration enabled, virtual clusters within that project are eligible to be
synced into Rancher as an imported cluster in Rancher UI. In the vCluster Platform UI, you can enable virtual cluster import into Rancher during the virtual cluster creation step, or by enabling this feature on existing
virtual clusters.

:::info Make Sure Your Project Has Rancher Enabled
If the project does *not* have Rancher integration enabled, you
will not see the "Add to Rancher" options in the virtual cluster configuration.
:::

<Tabs
    defaultValue="creation"
    values={[
        {label: 'During Virtual Cluster Creation', value: 'creation'},
        {label: 'On Existing Virtual Cluster', value: 'existing'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="creation">
        <Flow id="enable-rancher-import-creation">
            <Step>
                In the vCluster Platform UI, select a project that has Rancher integration enabled. 
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Click on Virtual Clusters and the <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                In the popup, optionally select the virtual cluster template, then click the
                <Button>Configure</Button> button.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Click the <Label>Rancher</Label> configuration tab.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Slide the <Label>Add to Rancher</Label> slider to enabled.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Finish configuring anything else you'd like on your virtual cluster, then click the
                <Button>Create</Button> button. The virtual cluster is created in vCluster Platform and imported into Rancher.
            </Step>
        </Flow>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="existing">
        <Flow id="enable-rancher-import-existing">
            <Step>
                 In the vCluster Platform UI, select a project that has Rancher integration enabled. 
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Find your desired virtual cluster in the virtual cluster list. Slide the
                <Label>Add to Rancher</Label> slider to import the virtual cluster into Rancher.
            </Step>
        </Flow>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Hiding nodes in Rancher

Since virtual clusters are not using physical nodes, you can hide the nodes from Rancher in order for the
virtual nodes to not be counted in your Rancher node count. In order to hide the nodes of your virtual cluster, you need to enable our Rancher nodeless plugin on the virtual cluster. 

Add the plugin to your `vcluster.yaml` configuration.

```yaml
plugins:
  rancher:
    image: ghcr.io/loft-sh/rancher-nodeless-plugin:0.0.5
```

:::tip Use Templates for plugins
You can enforce that all virtual clusters enable the plugin by enforcing template usage in the project. 
:::

## Disabe Rancher integration

You can disable the Rancher integration at either the virtual cluster or project level. This is done by toggling the same options used to enable the integration in the UI.

### Disable at the virtual cluster level

Disabling integration at the virtual cluster level removes the cluster from the Rancher UI, but the virtual cluster itself continues running in the background. This is useful if you want to stop managing a specific vCluster through Rancher without deleting it.

### Disable at the project level

:::note
Use caution when disabling integration at the project level, as this impacts all associated virtual clusters.
:::

Disabling integration at the project level removes all virtual clusters in that project from the Rancher UI. The virtual clusters remain active, but they are no longer visible or manageable through Rancher.
