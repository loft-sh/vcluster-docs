When using vCluster Platform with GitLab you can use the
official image `ghcr.io/loft-sh/vcluster-cli` as either a base image or
directly. If additional tooling is needed for your CI/CD process, a custom image can be created.

## Virtual Clusters for Merge Requests

This example shows how to create and delete a Virtual Cluster for running end-to-end tests for
the default branch and merge requests. It assumes you have configured CI/CD variables `VCLUSTER_PRO_URL`
and `VCLUSTER_PRO_ACCESS_KEY`.

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/loft-sh/vcluster-cli

stages:
  - test

e2e:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - vcluster login $VCLUSTER_PRO_URL --access-key $VCLUSTER_PRO_ACCESS_KEY
    - vcluster create "${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}" --upgrade
    - apk add go make
  script:
    - kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
    - kubectl rollout status deployments/my-app
    - make e2e
  after_script:
    - vcluster delete "${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}" --delete-namespace
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `ghcr.io/loft-sh/vcluster-cli` image is used for all pipeline jobs and provides the `vcluster` CLI, the
   `devspace` CLI, `helm`, and `kubectl`.
2. The `before_script` first logs in to vCluster Platform using the `$VCLUSTER_PRO_URL` and `$VCLUSTER_PRO_ACCESS_KEY`
   variables that you defined in GitLab.
   [See the GitLab docs for more information](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)
3. The `before_script` then creates a virtual cluster using
   [predefined GitLab variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html)
   to create a unique name. Optionally, the `--upgrade` flag can be used to reuse an existing virtual cluster instead of creating a new one.
4. Next `before_script` installs some additional tooling needed to run the end-to-end tests. For
   more complex scenarios creating a custom image is recommended.
5. Then the `script` section uses `kubectl` to deploy the application to the space and waits for
   the `my-app` deployment to become ready. `make` is then used to run an end-to-end test suite.
6. Finally `after_script` deletes the virtual cluster, and passes `--delete-namespace` to ensure the
   corresponding namespace for the virtual cluster is deleted. By using `after_script` we can ensure the virtual cluster
   is deleted even if the tests fail. You may wish to skip this step if reusing the virtual cluster with the `--upgrade` flag when creating the virtual cluster.

## Spaces for Merge Requests

This example shows how to create and delete a Space for running end-to-end tests for the default
branch and merge requests. It assumes you have configured CI/CD variables `LOFT_URL` and
`LOFT_ACCESS_KEY`.

```yaml {}
image: ghcr.io/loft-sh/loft-ci

stages:
  - test

e2e:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - loft login $LOFT_URL --access-key $LOFT_ACCESS_KEY
    - loft create space "${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}" --use
    - apk add go make
  script:
    - kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
    - kubectl rollout status deployments/my-app
    - make e2e
  after_script:
    - loft delete space "${CI_PROJECT_NAME}-${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}-${CI_PIPELINE_ID}"

```
