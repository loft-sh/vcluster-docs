## What are Projects?

Projects are the highest level organizational unit in vCluster Platform. In the simplest form, projects can be thought of as
folders for resources (e.g. virtual clusters), however, they also play an important role in
enforcing role based access and quotas within the platform.

### Members

Perhaps the most important aspect of projects is that they contain members, that is, users and teams that are a part
of the given project. Only users and teams that are part of the project (and global admins) will have access to the
project. Moreover, each user or team can be given specific roles that define their access within the
project. See the [Manage Project Members](./using-projects/members) section for more information.

### Templates

Projects contain a list of allowed templates that can be used by members to create virtual
cluster instances. Admins can configure default templates, or simply allow all templates for the project.
See the [Manage Allowed Templates](./using-projects/templates) section for more information.

### Allowed Clusters

Each project may define specific clusters that members of the project have access to. The member users and teams
will have their roles propagated to each allowed cluster. See the [Manage Allowed Clusters](./using-projects/clusters) section for more information.

### Quotas

Each project may define a quota to limit resource consumption. By limiting how much resources can be consumed helps prevent from any instance or user to abuse the cluster resources.
### Project Secrets

Each project can define secrets to be used within the project. See the [Manage Project Secrets](./secrets) section for more information.

### Integrations

To help in managing virtual clusters, our projects interate with various external tools like ArgoCD and Rancher. See the [Integrations](./integrations/argocd) section for more information on what integrations exist.
