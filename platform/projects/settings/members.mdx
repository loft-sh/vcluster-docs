Members are users or teams that are granted access to a project. Each member is assigned a role that
define their permissions. These roles will be granted to each of the [allowed clusters](clusters.mdx) of the
project. Only users and teams that are members of the project have access to the project's
allowed clusters.

## Project Roles

There are 3 default roles available for every project.

| Project User   | Yes                                  | Only owned and with explicit permission | No                      | Yes                  | Yes                                                 |
