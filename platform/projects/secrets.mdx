Project secrets allow you to define and share secrets across the allowed clusters. There are two ways to utilize project secrets. The first is to create a
project secret and populate it with its own secret data. The second is to sync a project secret with a [global secret](../secrets/what-are-secrets.mdx).
In both cases, to utilize the secret data, you will create a standard Kubernetes secret with labels referring to the
project secret. Once created, the platform will handle synchronizing the project secret data to your secret.

:::note Data or Global Secrets, but not both
It is not possible to define custom data in a project secret and synchronize a global secret. If
you need to define additional secret data that is specific to your project, it is best to create
a separate secret, and combine them in your pod specifications.

## Permissions for Project Secrets

Each project secret can have specific users/teams to view and modify the project secret.

## Creating Project Secret with Data

<Flow id="create-project-secret">
  <Step>
    Select the project you'd like to configure using the drop down menu. Click on <Label>Secrets</Label>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add a display name, such as "My Secret" and optional description for the
    project secret. The UI will automatically fill in the `.metadata.name` with
    `my-secret`. If you wish to change this name, you may edit the YAML directly.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the <NavStep>Data</NavStep> section, add your secret key/value pairs in the <Label>Data</Label> section.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on <NavStep>Permissions</NavStep>. Add which users and teams have access and permissions to modify the project secret.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button to save your changes.
  </Step>
</Flow>


## Creating Project Secrets synced from a Global Secret

When you have a global secret defined in the platform and wish to use it inside your project, you can create a project secret to be synced
from the global secret.

:::note Global Secret Permissions
When creating a project secret that refers to a global secret you must have permissions to read the shared secret or
the request will be denied.
:::

<Flow id="create-project-secret-from-shared-secret">
  <Step>
    Select the project you'd like to configure using the drop down menu. Click on <Label>Secrets</Label>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add a display name, such as "My Secret" and optional description for the
    project secret. The UI will automatically fill in the `.metadata.name` with
    `my-secret`. If you wish to change this name you may edit the YAML directly.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the <NavStep>Data</NavStep>, select the
    global secret that you wish to sync to the project secret in the <Label>Optional: Global Secret </Label> section.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on <NavStep>Permissions</NavStep>. Add which users and teams have access and permissions to modify the project secret.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button to save your changes.
  </Step>
</Flow>


## Using Project Secrets

To use a project secret, create a secret in the namespace where you need the project secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
  namespace: my-space
  labels:
    loft.sh/project-secret-name: my-secret
type: Opaque
```

The secret will be synchronized with the project secret momentarily.

:::note Virtual Cluster Secrets
Secrets inside virtual clusters will be synchronized whenever the project secret is modified. Since it would be
inefficient to watch secrets in all virtual clusters, the platform will instead synchronize virtual cluster secrets on an
interval.
