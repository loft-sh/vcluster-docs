The following defines the platform's lifecycle policy for releases and maintenance.

The platform aims to release on a regular cadence and follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We encourage users to run the latest stable release
to stay up to date on features and security patches.

Due to the rapid development of the platform, each minor version receives active support for 3 months after its release. Active support ends on the End of Support (EOS) end date. After the EOS end date, the version enters End of Life (EOL), during which only critical security updates are backported. During active support, updates from the active development branch can be backported upon request.

Any previous versions which are not on the following list, are no longer in any support window.

## Platform supported versions

| Release | Released | End of Support (EOS) End Date | End of Life (EOL) End Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| v4.2 | December 17, 2024 | September 17, 2025 | December 17, 2025 |
| v4.1 | November 12, 2024 | February 12, 2025 | May 12, 2025 |
| v4.0 | October 15, 2024 | January 15, 2025 | April 15, 2025 |
| v3.4| February 29, 2024 | April 1, 2025* | July 1, 2025 |

\* Due to the number of breaking changes from vCluster v0.19 to v0.20 and vCluster Platform v3.4 to v4.0, v3.4 has an extended EOS end date. Review the [migration guide](../../reference/migrations/4-0-migration.mdx) to upgrade your platform from v3.4 to v4.0.
