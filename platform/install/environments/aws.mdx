This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the platform on [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:
<BasePrerequisites />
- vCluster CLI <InstallCli />
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
- [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/installation/)
  :::note
  Ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions to create clusters and manage cloud services.

## Create AWS EKS cluster

<Flow id="create-eks-cluster">

<Step>
Prepare the environment.

Start by creating an AWS EKS cluster using the `eksctl` CLI. First, set up your environment variables:

```bash title="Set environment variables"
export CLUSTER_NAME=vcluster-demo
export REGION=eu-central-1
```

Configure AWS CLI:

```bash title="Configure AWS CLI"
aws configure
```
</Step>

<Step>
Create the cluster.

```bash title="Create AWS EKS cluster"
eksctl create cluster -n $CLUSTER_NAME --enable-auto-mode --region $REGION
```

  :::info
  This process typically takes about 10-15 minutes.
  :::

This command creates an AWS EKS cluster named `vcluster-demo` in the region `eu-central-1`.

<KubeconfigUpdate />

</Step>

<Step>
Verify the cluster creation.

Verify that the AWS EKS was created successfully by listing the nodes:

```bash title="List cluster nodes"
kubectl cluster-info
```

You should see output similar to:
```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://8F3D76A1C205B94E32D18FC96E04B73D.gr7.eu-central-1.eks.amazonaws.com
```

</Step>

</Flow>

## Platform setup

With the AWS EKS cluster up and running, you can now deploy the platform in a few
easy steps.

<Flow>

### Install the platform

<Step>
Deploy platform using the vCluster CLI.

Now that you have vCluster running on AWS EKS, set up the [platform
](/platform/install/quick-start-guide) and configure GPC in the following steps.

Easiest way to deploy a platform is using the `vcluster CLI`

:::note idempotency
Please note that the command is _idempotent_, meaning that running it again does
not result it creating another cluster with the same name.
:::

```bash title="deploy the platform using vcluster cli
vcluster platform start
```
The command asks you for providing email address for the admin user

```bash title="deployment expected output"
By providing your email, you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Statement:
Terms of Service: https://www.loft.sh/legal/terms
Privacy Statement: https://www.loft.sh/legal/privacy
? Please specify an email address for the admin user
```

:::tip retry
If the command takes to long to execute, for example due to other cluster
operations, simply run the command one more time
:::
</Step>

<Step>
Connect to the platform.

Once the platform is deployed, default browser with the platform UI opens and you should see the output similar to this:

```bash title="platform deployment output"
##########################   LOGIN   ############################

Username: admin
Password: 9758c908-b931-4edd-b3cb-3f034e50651a  # Change via UI or via: vcluster platform reset password

Login via UI:  https://hyx4907.loft.host
Login via CLI: vcluster platform login https://hyx4907.loft.host

#################################################################

vCluster Platform was successfully installed and can now be reached at: https://hyx4907.loft.host

Thanks for using vCluster Platform!
19:34:46 done You are successfully logged into vCluster Platform!
- Use `vcluster platform create vcluster` to create a new virtual cluster
- Use `vcluster platform add vcluster` to add an existing virtual cluster to a vCluster platform instance
```

When logging in via UI, provide: <Label>First Name</Label>, <Label>Last Name</Label>, <Label>Email</Label> (should default to
the one supplied earlier) and <Label>Organization</Label>.

To login via CLI, simply copy/pasted the `Login via CLI` command.

This is the basic platform deployment, from there you can refer to the [Next
steps seciton](#post-install-steps) to learn about platform features.

There are a few additional **optional** configuration steps that can be done.

- [Expose platform UI via load balancer](#load-balancer)
- [Setup custom domain and configure DNS](#setup-domain-dns)
</Step>

</Flow>

<Flow>

### [Optional] expose platform UI via load balancer {#load-balancer}

<Step>
Create a LoadBalancer service to expose the platform UI.

:::note
Please note that this
assumes the platform is deployed in the `vcluster-platform` namespace which is a
default deployment namespace.
:::

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: vcluster-platform-loadbalancer
  namespace: vcluster-platform
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  selector:
    app: loft
  ports:
  - name: https
    protocol: TCP
    port: 443
    targetPort: 10443
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step>
Once the service is active, obtain the external IP address:

```bash
kubectl get svc vcluster-platform-loadbalancer -n vcluster-platform
```

and navigate to the IP address in your browser `https://<EXTERNAL_IP>`.

:::tip certificate
Note that the platform uses a self-signed certificate, so you need to
accept the warning in your browser. For production use, you should [replace the certificate with a valid one.](/platform/configure/domain#configure-tls)
:::

</Step>

</Flow>

<Flow>

### [Optional] setup custom domain and configure DNS {#setup-domain-dns}

:::note
For this example we assume that your cluster has an [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/) installed.
You would also need an [AWS ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) Certificate [created and verified](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/setup.html).
:::

<Step>
Configure DNS in Route53.
To use a custom domain, you need to configure create a new Route53 hosted zone.

```bash title="Crete a Route53 Hosted Zone"
aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld --caller-reference vcluster-demo
```
</Step>

<Step>
Deploy an EKS Addon `external-dns`.

```bash title="Deploy external-dns"
eksctl create addon --name external-dns --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --auto-apply-pod-identity-associations
```
</Step>

<Step>
Create an Ingress object. Please replace `arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/certificate-id` with the correct value of the ACM certificate ARN.

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: vcluster-platform-ingress
  namespace: vcluster-platform
  annotations:
    # AWS Load Balancer Controller annotations
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS":443}]'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: '443'

    # ACM Certificate ARN
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/certificate-id

    # Keep your existing DNS annotation
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld

    # Additional helpful settings
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: vcluster-platform
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /healthz
spec:
  rules:
  - host: vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: loft
            port:
              number: 10443
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step>
Connect the platform to the custom domain.

Once the DNS is setup, the platform can be started with the command `vcluster
platform start --host=vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld`

:::info
Read more about how to configure a custom [domain](/platform/configure/domain).

If you do not have a custom domain setup, [follow this
tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/tutorials/create-domain-tutorial).

</Step>

</Flow>

## Next steps {#post-install-steps}

<InstallNextSteps />

You can also use Google as identity provider and [configure SSO ](/platform/configure/single-sign-on/providers/google)to enable user
authentication to the platform.

## Cleanup

If you deployed the AWS EKS cluster with this tutorial, and want to clean up the resources, run the
following command:

```bash title="Clean up resources"
eksctl delete cluster -n $CLUSTER_NAME
```

Please don't forget to also cleanup an ACM certificate and Route53 hosted zone if needed.
