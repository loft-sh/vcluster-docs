This guide provides instructions for deploying the platform on [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:
<BasePrerequisites />
- vCluster CLI installed: <InstallCli />
- `AWS CLI` installed:  Command-line tool for interacting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and services. For more details on installation, see the [AWS CLI user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
- `eksctl`: Command-line utility that simplifies creating and managing Kubernetes clusters on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). For more details on installation, see the [eksctl documentation](https://eksctl.io/installation/).
:::note
Ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions to create clusters and manage cloud services.

## Create an AWS EKS cluster

<Flow id="create-eks-cluster">

<Step> 
Configure the AWS CLI.

Run the following command and provide your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and preferred output format when prompted:

```bash title="Configure AWS CLI"
aws configure
```

This sets up local credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` and stores your default region and output format in `~/.aws/config`. This enables the AWS CLI and tools like eksctl to authenticate and access AWS services.

</Step>

<Step> 
Set environment variables. 

<!-- vale off -->
<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={
`export CLUSTER_NAME=[[VAR:CLUSTER_NAME:vcluster-demo]]
export REGION=[[VAR:REGION:eu-central-1]]`
  }
  language="bash"
  title="Set environment variables"
/>
</Step>

<Step> 
[Create an AWS EKS cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html) using the `eksctl` CLI:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={
`eksctl create cluster \\
  -n=[[VAR:CLUSTER_NAME:vcluster-demo]] \\
  --enable-auto-mode \\
  --region=[[VAR:REGION:eu-central-1]]`
  }
  language="bash"
  title="Create AWS EKS cluster"
/>

:::info
This process typically takes about 10-15 minutes.
:::

This command creates an AWS EKS cluster named `vcluster-demo` in the region `eu-central-1`.

<KubeconfigUpdate />

</Step>

<Step>
Verify the cluster creation.

Verify that the AWS EKS was created successfully by getting the cluster info:

```bash title="List cluster nodes"
kubectl cluster-info
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

```bash title="Example output"
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://8F3D76A1C205B94E32D18FC96E04B73D.gr7.eu-central-1.eks.amazonaws.com
```
</Step>

</Flow>

## Set up the platform

After the AWS EKS cluster is running, deploy the platform.

### Install the platform

<Flow>

<Step>
[Deploy the platform](/platform/install/quick-start-guide) using the vCluster CLI:

:::note idempotency
The following command is _idempotent_, meaning that running it again does
not result it creating another cluster with the same name.
:::

```bash title="Deploy the platform using the vCluster CLI
vcluster platform start
```
The command prompts you to enter the email address for the admin user:

```bash title="deployment expected output"
By providing your email, you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Statement:
Terms of Service: https://www.loft.sh/legal/terms
Privacy Statement: https://www.loft.sh/legal/privacy
? Please specify an email address for the admin user
```

:::tip
If the command takes too long to execute—such as when other cluster operations are in progress—rerun the command.
:::
</Step>

<Step>
Connect to the platform.

After the platform is deployed, your default browser opens with the platform UI, and you should see output similar to the following:


```bash title="platform deployment output"
##########################   LOGIN   ############################

Username: admin
Password: 9758c908-b931-4edd-b3cb-3f034e50651a  # Change via UI or via: vcluster platform reset password

Login via UI:  https://hyx4907.loft.host
Login via CLI: vcluster platform login https://hyx4907.loft.host

#################################################################

vCluster Platform was successfully installed and can now be reached at: https://hyx4907.loft.host

Thanks for using vCluster platform!
19:34:46 done You are successfully logged into vCluster Platform!
- Use `vcluster platform create vcluster` to create a new virtual cluster
- Use `vcluster platform add vcluster` to add an existing virtual cluster to a vCluster platform instance
```

When logging in via the UI, provide the following details:

- **First Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Email** (pre-filled with the address you supplied earlier)
- **Organization**

To log in via the CLI, run the `Login via CLI` command provided above.

This completes the basic platform deployment. For additional configuration and available features, see the [Next steps section](#post-install-steps).

You can _optionally_ perform additional configuration steps:

- [Expose the platform UI using the load balancer](#load-balancer)
- [Set up a custom domain and configure DNS](#setup-domain-dns)
</Step>
</Flow>


### Expose platform UI using the load balancer {#load-balancer}

Optionally, you can expose the platform UI using a LoadBalancer service to make it accessible outside the cluster.

<Flow>
<Step>
Create a LoadBalancer service to expose the platform UI.

:::note
This assumes the platform is deployed in the `vcluster-platform` namespace which is a
default deployment namespace.
:::

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: vcluster-platform-loadbalancer
  namespace: vcluster-platform
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  selector:
    app: loft
  ports:
  - name: https
    protocol: TCP
    port: 443
    targetPort: 10443
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step>
After the service is active, obtain the external IP address:

```bash
kubectl get svc vcluster-platform-loadbalancer -n vcluster-platform
```

Navigate to the IP address in your browser `https://<EXTERNAL_IP>`.

:::tip
The platform uses a self-signed certificate, so you must
accept the warning in your browser. For production use, replace the default self-signed certificate with a valid [TLS certificate](/platform/configure/domain#configure-tls).
:::
</Step>
</Flow>


### Set up custom domain and configure DNS {#setup-domain-dns}

Optionally, you can set up a custom domain and configure DNS to provide a secure URL for accessing the platform.

:::note
This example assumes that your cluster has the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/) installed.
You must also have an SSL/TLS certificate issued by [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) that is [created and verified](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/setup.html).
:::

<Flow>
<Step>
Configure DNS in Amazon Route 53.
To use a custom domain, you must create a new Route 53 hosted zone:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={
`aws route53 create-hosted-zone \\
  --name=[[VAR:DOMAIN NAME:vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld]] \\
  --caller-reference=[[VAR:CALLER REFERENCE:vcluster-demo]]`}
  language="bash"
  title="Create a Route 53 Hosted Zone"
/>
</Step>

<Step>
Deploy the `external-dns` EKS add-on. 

This add-on automatically manages DNS records based on Kubernetes resources such as `Ingress` and `Service`. It integrates with Route 53 and eliminates the need to manually create or update DNS entries.

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={
`eksctl create addon \\
  --name=external-dns \\
  --cluster=[[VAR:CLUSTER_NAME:vcluster-demo]] \\
  --auto-apply-pod-identity-associations`}
  language="bash"
  title="Deploy external-dns"
/>
</Step>

<Step>
Create an `Ingress` object. 
Replace `arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/certificate-id` with the correct value of the ACM certificate Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={
`cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: [[VAR:INGRESS NAME:vcluster-platform-ingress]]
  namespace: [[VAR:NAMESPACE:vcluster-platform]]
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/listen-ports: '[{"HTTPS":443}]'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: '443'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: [[VAR:ACM CERTIFICATE ARN:arn:aws:acm:region:account-id:certificate/certificate-id]]
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: [[VAR:DNS HOSTNAME:vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld]]
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: [[VAR:ALB GROUP NAME:vcluster-platform]]
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: [[VAR:HEALTHCHECK PATH:/healthz]]
spec:
  rules:
  - host: [[VAR:DNS HOSTNAME:vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld]]
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: [[VAR:SERVICE NAME:loft]]
            port:
              number: [[VAR:SERVICE PORT:10443]]
EOF`}
  language="bash"
  title="Create Ingress for platform UI"
/>
</Step>

<Step>
Connect the platform to the custom domain.

After the DNS is setup, start the platform with the following command: 

`vcluster platform start --host=vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld`

:::info
For more information on how to configure a custom domain, see the [Configure external acess and TLS documentation](/platform/configure/domain).

If you do not have a custom domain setup, follow the [Set up a domain by using Cloud DNS
tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/tutorials/create-domain-tutorial).

## Next steps {#post-install-steps}

<InstallNextSteps />

You can also use Google as an identity provider and [configure SSO](/platform/configure/single-sign-on/providers/google) to enable user
authentication to the platform.

## Cleanup

If you deployed the AWS EKS cluster with this tutorial, and want to clean up the resources, run the
following command:

```bash title="Clean up resources"
eksctl delete cluster -n $CLUSTER_NAME
```
Remember to clean up the ACM certificate and Route 53 hosted zone if they are no longer needed.
