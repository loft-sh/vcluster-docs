This guide provides instructions for deploying the platform on [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), a managed Kubernetes service on Google Cloud.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:
<BasePrerequisites />
- vCluster CLI installed: <InstallCli />
- [Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` CLI)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed.
:::note
Ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions to create clusters and manage cloud services.
:::

## Create a GKE cluster

<Flow id="create-gke-cluster">

<Step>
Prepare the environment.

Start by creating a zonal GKE cluster using the `gcloud` CLI. Set up your environment variables:

:::tip
Project ID can be found in the Google Cloud Console under the project name.
Alternatively use `gcloud project list` to list all projects and their IDs.
To check which project is active, use `gcloud config get-value project`.
:::

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`export PROJECT_ID=[[VAR:PROJECT_ID:development]]
export CLUSTER_NAME=[[VAR:CLUSTER_NAME:vcluster-demo]]
export ZONE=[[VAR:ZONE:europe-west1-b]]
export MACHINE_TYPE=[[VAR:MACHINE_TYPE:e2-standard-4]]`}
  language="bash"
  title="Set environment variables"
/>

Configure `gcloud`, enable the required APIs, and set the default project:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`gcloud config set project=[[VAR:PROJECT_ID:your-project-id]]
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com`}
  language="bash"
  title="Configure gcloud"
/>
</Step>

<Step>
Create the cluster.

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`gcloud container clusters create=[[VAR:CLUSTER_NAME:vcluster-demo]] \\
    --zone=[[VAR:ZONE:europe-west1-b]] \\
    --machine-type=[[VAR:MACHINE_TYPE:e2-standard-4]] \\
    --num-nodes=2`}
  language="bash"
  title="Create GKE cluster"
/>

  :::info
  This process typically takes about 10-15 minutes.
  :::

Using default values, this command creates a GKE cluster named `vcluster-demo` in the `europe-west1-b`
zone with two nodes of type `e2-standard-4`.

<KubeconfigUpdate />

</Step>

<Step>
Verify the cluster creation.

Verify that GKE was created successfully by listing the nodes:

```bash title="List cluster nodes"
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

```bash title="Example output"
NAME           LOCATION        MASTER_VERSION      MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION        NUM_NODES  STATUS
vcluster-demo  europe-west1-b  1.30.5-gke.1443001  35.187.66.218  e2-standard-4  1.30.5-gke.1443001  2          RUNNING
```

</Step>

</Flow>

## Set up the platform

After the GKE cluster is running, deploy the platform.


### Install the platform

<Flow>
<Step>
[Deploy the platform](/platform/install/quick-start-guide) using the vCluster CLI.

:::note idempotency
The following command is _idempotent_, meaning that running it again does
not result it creating another cluster with the same name.
:::

```bash title="Deploy the platform using vCluster CLI
vcluster platform start
```

The command prompts you to enter the email address for the admin user:

```bash title="Expected deployment output"
By providing your email, you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Statement:
Terms of Service: https://www.loft.sh/legal/terms
Privacy Statement: https://www.loft.sh/legal/privacy
? Please specify an email address for the admin user
```

:::tip
If the command takes too long to execute—such as when other cluster operations are in progress—rerun the command.
:::

</Step>

<Step>
Connect to the platform.

After the platform is deployed, your default browser opens with the platform UI, and you should see output similar to the following:

```bash title="platform deployment output"
##########################   LOGIN   ############################

Username: admin
Password: 9758c908-b931-4edd-b3cb-3f034e50651a  # Change via UI or via: vcluster platform reset password

Login via UI:  https://hyx4907.loft.host
Login via CLI: vcluster platform login https://hyx4907.loft.host

#################################################################

vCluster Platform was successfully installed and can now be reached at: https://hyx4907.loft.host

Thanks for using vCluster Platform!
19:34:46 done You are successfully logged into vCluster Platform!
- Use `vcluster platform create vcluster` to create a new virtual cluster
- Use `vcluster platform add vcluster` to add an existing virtual cluster to a vCluster platform instance
```

When logging in using the UI, provide the following details:

- **First Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Email** (pre-filled with the address you supplied earlier)
- **Organization**

To log in using the CLI, run the `Login via CLI` command provided above.

This completes the basic platform deployment. For additional configuration and available features, see the [Next steps section](#post-install-steps).

You can _optionally_ perform additional configuration steps:

- [Expose the platform UI using the load balancer](#load-balancer)
- [Set up a custom domain and configure DNS](#setup-domain-dns)

</Step>
</Flow>


### Expose the platform UI using load balancer {#load-balancer}

<Flow>
<Step>
Optionally, you can expose the platform UI using a LoadBalancer service to make it accessible outside the cluster.

:::note
This assumes the platform is deployed in the `vcluster-platform` namespace which is a
default deployment namespace.
:::

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: vcluster-platform-loadbalancer
  namespace: vcluster-platform
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  selector:
    app: loft
  ports:
  - name: https
    protocol: TCP
    port: 443
    targetPort: 10443
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step>
After the service is active, obtain the external IP address:

```bash
kubectl get svc vcluster-platform-loadbalancer -n vcluster-platform
```

Navigate to the IP address in your browser `https://<EXTERNAL_IP>`.

:::tip
The platform uses a self-signed certificate, so you must
accept the warning in your browser. For production use, replace the default self-signed certificate with a valid [TLS certificate](/platform/configure/domain#configure-tls).
:::

</Step>

</Flow>


### Set up custom domain and configure DNS {#setup-domain-dns}

Optionally, you can set up a custom domain and configure DNS to provide a secure URL for accessing the platform.

<Flow>
<Step>
[Configure DNS in Google Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/set-up-dns-records-domain-name).

To use a custom domain, you must configure the DNS to point to the LoadBalancer IP address.

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={
`EXTERNAL_IP=[[VAR:EXTERNAL_IP:load-balancer-external-IP]]

gcloud dns managed-zones create [[VAR:DNS_ZONE_NAME:vcluster-platform]] --dns-name="[[VAR:DOMAIN:yourdomain.tld.]]"

gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone=[[VAR:DNS_ZONE_NAME:vcluster-platform]]

gcloud dns record-sets transaction add "\${EXTERNAL_IP}" \\
  --name="[[VAR:FQDN:vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld.]]" \\
  --ttl=300 \\
  --type=A \\
  --zone=[[VAR:DNS_ZONE_NAME:vcluster-platform]]

gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone=[[VAR:DNS_ZONE_NAME:vcluster-platform]]`}
  language="bash"
  title="Configure DNS"
/>
</Step>

<Step>
Connect the platform to the custom domain.

After DNS is set up, you can start the platform using the following command:
`vcluster platform start --host=vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld

:::info
For more information on how to configure a custom domain, see the [Configure external acess and TLS documentation](/platform/configure/domain).

If you do not have a custom domain setup, follow the [Set up a domain by using Cloud DNS
tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/tutorials/create-domain-tutorial).
:::

</Step>
</Flow>

## Next steps {#post-install-steps}

<InstallNextSteps />

You can also use Google as an identity provider and [configure SSO](/platform/configure/single-sign-on/providers/google) to enable user
authentication to the platform.


## Cleanup

If you deployed the GKE cluster with this tutorial, and want to clean up the resources, run the
following command:

```bash title="Clean up resources"
gcloud container clusters delete $CLUSTER_NAME --zone $ZONE --quiet
```
