This guide provides instructions for deploying the platform on Azure using [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/).

<!-- vale off -->
## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:
<BasePrerequisites />

- vCluster CLI installed: <InstallCli />
- [Azure CLI (`az`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) installed.

:::note
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create clusters and manage Azure services.
:::

## Create an AKS cluster

<Flow id="create-aks-cluster">

<Step>
Prepare the environment.

Create an AKS cluster using the `az` CLI. Set up your environment variables:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`export RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=[[VAR:RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME:vcluster-demo-ResourceGroup]]
export REGION=[[VAR:REGION:westeurope]]
export CLUSTER_NAME=[[VAR:CLUSTER_NAME:vcluster-demo]]
export DNS_LABEL=[[VAR:DNS_LABEL:vcluster-demo-dns]]
`}
  language="bash"
  title="Set environment variables"
/>
</Step>

<Step>
(Optional) Create a resource group if the specified resource group name does not exist:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $REGION`}
  language="bash"
  title="Create a resource group"
/>
</Step>

<Step>
Create the cluster:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`az aks create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME --node-count 2`}
  language="bash"
  title="Create an AKS cluster"
/>

  :::info
  This process typically takes about 10-15 minutes.
  :::

Using the default values, this command creates a AKS cluster named `vcluster-demo` in the `westeurope`
region with two nodes.

</Step>

<Step>
Download the kubeconfig file for the new cluster:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME`}
  language="bash"
  title="Get Kubeconfig"
/>
</Step>

<Step>
Verify the cluster creation.

Verify that AKS was created successfully by listing the nodes:

```bash title="List cluster nodes"
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see an output similar to the following:

```bash title="Example output"
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
aks-nodepool1-41068841-vmss000000   Ready    <none>   6m4s    v1.31.8
aks-nodepool1-41068841-vmss000001   Ready    <none>   6m11s   v1.31.8
```

</Step>

</Flow>

## Set up the platform

After the AKS cluster is running, deploy the platform.

### Install the platform

<Flow>
<Step>
[Deploy the platform](/platform/install/quick-start-guide) using the vCluster CLI.

:::note idempotency
The following command is _idempotent_, meaning that running it again does
not result in creating another cluster with the same name.
:::

```bash title="Deploy the platform using vCluster CLI
vcluster platform start
```

The command prompts you to enter the email address for the admin user:

```bash title="Expected deployment output"
By providing your email, you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Statement:
Terms of Service: https://www.loft.sh/legal/terms
Privacy Statement: https://www.loft.sh/legal/privacy
? Please specify an email address for the admin user
```

:::tip
If the command takes too long to execute—such as when other cluster operations are in progress—rerun the command.
:::

</Step>

<Step>
Connect to the platform.

After the platform is deployed, your default browser opens with the platform UI, and you should see output similar to the following:

```bash title="platform deployment output"
##########################   LOGIN   ############################

Username: admin
Password: 9758c908-b931-4edd-b3cb-3f034e50651a  # Change via UI or via: vcluster platform reset password

Login via UI:  https://hyx4907.loft.host
Login via CLI: vcluster platform login https://hyx4907.loft.host

#################################################################

vCluster Platform was successfully installed and can now be reached at: https://hyx4907.loft.host

Thanks for using vCluster Platform!
19:34:46 done You are successfully logged into vCluster Platform!
- Use `vcluster platform create vcluster` to create a new virtual cluster
- Use `vcluster platform add vcluster` to add an existing virtual cluster to a vCluster platform instance
```

When logging in using the UI, provide the following details:

- **First Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Email** (pre-filled with the address you supplied earlier)
- **Organization**

To log in using the CLI, run the `Login via CLI` command provided above.

This completes the basic platform deployment. For additional configuration and available features, see the [Next steps section](#post-install-steps).

You can _optionally_ perform additional configuration steps:

- [Expose the platform UI using the load balancer](#load-balancer)
- [Set up a custom domain and configure DNS](#setup-domain-dns)

</Step>
</Flow>

### Expose the platform UI using LoadBalancer {#load-balancer}

<Flow>
<Step>
Optionally, you can expose the platform UI using a LoadBalancer service to make it accessible outside the cluster.

:::note
This assumes the platform is deployed in the `vcluster-platform` namespace which is a
default deployment namespace.
:::

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: vcluster-platform-loadbalancer
  namespace: vcluster-platform
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  selector:
    app: loft
  ports:
  - name: https
    protocol: TCP
    port: 443
    targetPort: 10443
EOF

```

</Step>

<Step>
After the service is active, obtain the external IP address:

```bash
kubectl get svc vcluster-platform-loadbalancer -n vcluster-platform
```

Navigate to the IP address in your browser `https://<EXTERNAL_IP>`.

:::tip
The platform uses a self-signed certificate, so you should
accept the warning in your browser. For production use, replace the default self-signed certificate with a valid [TLS certificate](/platform/configure/domain#configure-tls).
:::

</Step>

</Flow>

### Set up custom domain and configure DNS {#setup-domain-dns}

Optionally, you can set up a custom domain, SSL certificate, and configure DNS to provide a secure URL for accessing the platform.
[Official Azure guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing-dns-ssl)

<Flow>
<Step>
All necessary steps for configuring DNS and SSL for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) App Routing are thoroughly described in the official Azure documentation.
Please refer to the guide here: [Configure DNS and SSL for AKS App Routing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing-dns-ssl).
</Step>

<Step>
Connect the platform to the custom domain.

After DNS is set up, you can start the platform using the following command:

```bash
vcluster platform start --host=vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld
```

:::info
For more information on how to configure a custom domain, see the [Configure external access and TLS documentation](/platform/configure/domain).
:::

</Step>
</Flow>

## Next steps {#post-install-steps}

<InstallNextSteps />

You can also use Google as an identity provider and [configure SSO](/platform/configure/single-sign-on/providers/google) to enable user authentication to the platform.

## Clean up resources

If you deployed the AKS cluster using this guide, and want to clean up the resources, run the
following command:

```bash title="Clean up resources"
az aks delete --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --name $CLUSTER_NAME
```
