The **vCluster CLI** is the preferred method for deploying the platform to a Kubernetes cluster.
It streamlines the installation process and ensures compatibility with your Kubernetes environment.
If you later decide to manage your platform instance via GitOps, you can export the applied Kubernetes manifests or Helm chart configuration and store them in a Git repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- Admin access to a Kubernetes cluster: Your current kube-context must have administrative privileges. See [Accessing Clusters with kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) for more information.
- Helm v3 installed: Helm is required for deploying the platform. Refer to the [Helm Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) if you need to install it.
- `kubectl` installed: Kubernetes command-line tool for interacting with the cluster. See [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) for installation instructions.

## Download and install vCluster CLI

Use one of the following commands to download the vCluster CLI binary from GitHub:

<InstallCLI />

:::tip
After installation, verify the successful installation of the vCluster CLI by running `vcluster version` in your terminal. This command should display the installed version of the vCluster CLI.
:::

## Deploy the platform

Before deploying the platform, ensure the correct host cluster kube-context is in use. The host cluster kube-context configures which Kubernetes cluster and namespace `kubectl` commands interact with. To confirm the current context, run:

```bash title="Get the current Kubernetes context"
kubectl config current-context
```

Once you've confirmed the correct context, deploy the platform by running:

```bash title="Deploy the platform"
vcluster platform start
```

This command deploys the platform onto the host-cluster in the `vcluster-platform` namespace.
The `vcluster-platform` namespace is created automatically and serves as a
dedicated space for the platform components.

The UI automatically opens in your browser and logs you in. You are asked for your user details to create the administrator user.

:::info
The deployment process typically takes less than 1 minute, but can take up to 2 minutes depending on your cluster's resources and network speed.
:::

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash title="Platform installation output"

vCluster Platform was successfully installed and can now be reached at: https://hth45c8.loft.host
Thanks for using vCluster Platform!
11:38:33 done You are successfully logged into vCluster Platform!
- Use `vcluster platform create vcluster` to create a new virtual cluster
- Use `vcluster platform add vcluster` to add an existing virtual cluster to a vCluster platform instance
```

After successful deployment, the UI automatically opens in your default web
browser. You are prompted to create an administrator user.

:::tip Troubleshooting
If your platform pod is not starting or the UI is not showing up, view the [Troubleshooting Guide](../use-platform/troubleshooting) for assistance.
:::

## Log in to the platform

While `vcluster platform start` logs you in automatically, you can also manually log in via the CLI:

```bash title="Platform login"
vcluster login https://1rtjxak.loft.host      # See `vCluster platform start` output for login credentials and your actual sub-domain name (auto-generated).
```

This command opens the browser for signing in using the login data displayed in the output of `vcluster platform start`. Manual login may be necessary if accessing the platform from a different machine or if the automatic login process is interrupted.
