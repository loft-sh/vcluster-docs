The **vCluster CLI** is the preferred method for deploying the platform to a Kubernetes cluster. It streamlines the installation process and ensures compatibility with your Kubernetes environment. If you later decide to manage your platform instance via GitOps, you can export the applied Kubernetes manifests or Helm chart configuration and store them in a Git repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- Admin access to a Kubernetes cluster: Your current kube-context must have administrative privileges. See [Accessing Clusters with kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) for more information.
- Helm v3 installed: Helm is required for deploying the platform. Refer to the [Helm Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) if you need to install it.
- `kubectl` installed: Kubernetes command-line tool for interacting with the cluster. See [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) for installation instructions.

## Download and Install vCluster CLI

Use one of the following commands to download the vCluster CLI binary from GitHub:

<InstallCLI />

## Deploy the Platform

Confirm that you are using the correct host cluster kube-context via `kubectl config current-context` and then run:

```bash title="Deploy the platform"
vcluster platform start
```

This will deploy vCluster Platform onto the host-cluster in the `vcluster-platform` namespace.
The UI will automatically open in your browser and log you in. You will be asked for your user details to create the admin user.

:::info
The deployment process typically takes about 5-10 minutes, depending on your cluster's resources and network speed.

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash title="Platform Installation Output"

vCluster Platform was successfully installed and can now be reached at: https://hth45c8.loft.host
Thanks for using vCluster Platform!
11:38:33 done You are successfully logged into vCluster Platform!
- Use `vcluster create` to create a new virtual cluster
- Use `vcluster platform add vcluster` to add an existing virtual cluster to a vCluster platform instance
```

This command deploys the platform into the `vcluster-platform` namespace of your Kubernetes cluster. Upon successful deployment, the UI will automatically open in your default web browser. You will be prompted to create an admin user by providing your user details.

:::tip Troubleshooting
If your platform pod is not starting or the UI is not showing up, view the [Troubleshooting Guide](../use-platform/troubleshooting) for assistance.

## Logging in

While `vcluster platform start` logs you in automatically, you can also manually login via the CLI:

```bash
vcluster login https://1rtjxak.loft.host      # See `vcluster platform start` output for login credentials and your actual sub-domain name (auto-generated).
```

This command will open the browser where you can sign in using the login data shown in the
output of `vcluster platform start`.
