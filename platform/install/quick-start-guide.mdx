The **vCluster CLI** is the preferred method for deploying the vCluster Platform to a Kubernetes cluster. It streamlines the installation process and ensures compatibility with your Kubernetes environment. If you later decide to manage your vCluster Platform instance via GitOps, you can export the applied Kubernetes manifests or Helm chart configuration and store them in a Git repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- **Admin access to a Kubernetes cluster**: Your current kube-context must have administrative privileges. See [Accessing Clusters with kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) for more information.
- **Helm v3 installed**: Helm is required for deploying the vCluster Platform. Refer to the [Helm Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) if you need to install it.
- **kubectl installed**: Kubernetes command-line tool for interacting with the cluster. See [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) for installation instructions.

## 1. Download and Install vCluster CLI

Use one of the following commands to download the vCluster CLI binary from GitHub:

<InstallCLI />

## 2. Deploy the vCluster Platform

Confirm that you are using the correct host cluster kube-context via `kubectl config current-context` and then run:

```bash
vcluster platform start
```
This will deploy vCluster Platform into the host `vcluster-platform` namespace.
The UI will automatically open in your browser and log you in. You will be asked for your user details to create the admin user.

:::tip Troubleshooting
Your vCluster Platform pod is not starting or the UI is not showing up? View the
[Troubleshooting Guide](../use-platform/troubleshooting) if you have any
issues.

## 3. Logging in

While `vcluster platform start` logs you in automatically, you can also manually login via the CLI:

```bash
vcluster login https://1rtjxak.loft.host      # See `vcluster platform start` output for login credentials and your actual sub-domain name (auto-generated).
```

This command will open the browser where you can sign in using the login data shown in the
output of `vcluster platform start`.


## 4. Create Virtual Clusters

After logging into the UI, you'll be able to start creating virtual clusters immediately. You're automatically part of a [project](../understand/what-are-projects.mdx) called `Default Project`.

Click on "New Virtual Cluster" and "Create" to spin one up to try out.

Otherwise, read more about some primary concepts:

* [Virtual Clusters](../understand/what-are-virtual-clusters.mdx) - How to create and manage virtual clusters
* [Templates](../understand/what-are-templates.mdx) - How to use templates to control what type of resources that can be made
