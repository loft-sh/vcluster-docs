Using vCluster CLI is the preferred way to deploy vCluster Platform to a Kubernetes cluster. If you decide later
on you want to manage your vCluster Platform instance via GitOps, you may export the applied Kubernetes
manifests or Helm chart configuration and store this data in a git repository.

## 1. Download and Install vCluster CLI

Use one of the following commands to download the vCluster CLI binary from GitHub:

<InstallCLI />

## 2. Deploy the vCluster Platform

:::caution Prerequisites
Please make sure you meet the following requirements
before running this command:
1. Current kube-context has admin access to the cluster
2. Helm v3 must be installed
3. kubectl must be installed
:::

Confirm that you are using the correct host cluster kube-context via `kubectl config current-context` and then run:

```bash
vcluster platform start
```
This will deploy vCluster Platform into the host `vcluster-platform` namespace.
The UI will automatically open in your browser and log you in. You will be asked for your user details to create the admin user.

:::tip Troubleshooting
Your vCluster Platform pod is not starting or the UI is not showing up? View the
[Troubleshooting Guide](../troubleshooting) if you have any
issues.

## 3. Logging in

While `vcluster platform start` logs you in automatically, you can also manually login via the CLI:

```bash
vcluster login https://1rtjxak.loft.host      # See `vcluster platform start` output for login credentials and your actual sub-domain name (auto-generated).
```

This command will open the browser where you can sign in using the login data shown in the
output of `vcluster platform start`.


## 4. Create Virtual Clusters

After logging into the UI, you'll be able to start creating virtual clusters immediately. You're automatically part of a [project](../projects/what-are-projects.mdx) called `Default Project`. 

Click on "New Virtual Cluster" and "Create" to spin one up to try out! 

Otherwise, read more about some primary concepts:

* [Projects](../projects/what-are-projects.mdx) - How resources can be grouped together into different projects
* [Virtual Clusters](../virtual-clusters/what-are-virtual-clusters.mdx) - How to create and manage virtual clusters
* [Templates](../templates/what-are-templates.mdx) - How to use templates to control what type of resources that can be made
* [Host Clusters](../clusters/what-are-clusters.mdx) - How to add more host clusters to the platform
