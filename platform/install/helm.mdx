vCluster Platform can be installed directly via Helm, in fact, even when following the recommend installation
procedure in the Getting Started Guide the vCluster CLI is actually using Helm
to install vCluster Platform.

Managing the vCluster Platform installation with Helm directly can be a great way to "GitOps" your vCluster Platform
installation, by using ArgoCD or other GitOps tools to manage the vCluster Platform deployment via Helm and
appropriate Helm values. This section outlines the basics of installing and managing vCluster Platform with
Helm, and should serve as a solid starting point for managing vCluster Platform
in a GitOps fashion as well.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) is required for installing vCluster Platform.

vCluster Platform installation via Helm looks like any other Helm install command. Update `$RELEASE_NAME` and `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with your desired values.

If you haven't done so, add the Loft Helm repository and update the
Helm repositories.

```bash
helm repo add loft https://charts.loft.sh
helm repo update
```

:::tip
To retrieve all available versions of the vCluster Platform Helm chart, you can
run the following command:

```bash
helm search repo loft-sh/vcluster-platform
```
:::

```bash
RELEASE_NAME=vcluster-platform
RELEASE_NAMESPACE=vcluster-platform
PLATFORM_VERSION='' # Set this to a specific version or leave empty for latest

helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME vcluster-platform \
  --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace $RELEASE_NAMESPACE \
  --create-namespace \
  ${PLATFORM_VERSION:+--version $PLATFORM_VERSION}
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
Release "vcluster-platform" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: vcluster-platform
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Oct  4 13:10:52 2024
# highlight-start
NAMESPACE: vcluster-platform
STATUS: deployed
# highlight-end
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Thank you for installing vcluster-platform.
```

## Configuration

The vCluster Platform Configuration options (as seen in the vCluster Platform UI `Admin` > `Config` section) are
configurable via vCluster Platform Helm values just like any other deployment options. These values are set
under the `config` section of the chart values, you can see the available configuration options
in the Configuration Section of the docs [here](../configure/config.mdx).

While all configuration settings are optional, it is always recommended to deploy vCluster Platform with the
`loftHost` configuration set. This config option tells vCluster Platform what its own publicly resolvable
hostname is and is necessary for some integrations, including ArgoCD, and SSO.

### Values File

As with most Helm charts, the vCluster Platform chart supports many user configurable values to modify the
installation. You can find the vCluster Platform chart in the vCluster Platform public repository
[here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart). The `values.yaml` file in the
chart repository contains the default values, as well as many comments showing optional values
and some additional information.

Users can copy the default values file and modify it to suite their deployment needs, or create
a new YAML file containing only the desired values settings. An example values file `values.yaml`
is outlined below.

```yaml
config:
  audit:
    enabled: true
  loftHost: vcluster-platform.mytld.com

ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: vcluster-platform.mytld.com
```

Values files can then be passed to the Helm upgrade command. Update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid vCluster Platform version.

```bash
RELEASE_NAME=vcluster-platform
RELEASE_NAMESPACE=vcluster-platform
PLATFORM_VERSION='' # Set this to a specific version or leave empty for latest

helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME vcluster-platform \
  --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace $RELEASE_NAMESPACE \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values.yaml \
  ${PLATFORM_VERSION:+--version $PLATFORM_VERSION}
```

You can provide multiple values files if desired by specifying additional filenames after the
`--values` flag. This can be handy if you like to break up the values sections into different files.

Helm has many additional flags, and other ways to pass values, as always, its a great idea to
check out the Helm [docs](https://helm.sh/docs/) to stay up to date on Helm.
