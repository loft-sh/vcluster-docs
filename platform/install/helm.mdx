vCluster Platform can be installed directly via Helm, in fact, even when following the recommend installation
procedure in the Getting Started Guide the vCluster CLI is actually using Helm to install vCluster Platform!

Managing the vCluster Platform installation with Helm directly can be a great way to "GitOps" your vCluster Platform
installation, by using ArgoCD or other GitOps tools to manage the vCluster Platform deployment via Helm and
appropriate Helm values. This section outlines the basics of installing and managing vCluster Platform with
Helm, and should serve as a solid starting point for managing vCluster Platform in a GitOps fashion as well!

## Simple Installation

The most basic vCluster Platform installation via Helm looks like any other Helm install command and can be
seen below:

```bash
helm upgrade [RELASE NAME] vcluster-control-plane --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform
```

Typically, users will simply call the release name `vcluster-platform`. If the `vcluster-platform` namespace does not
already exist, you can add the `--create-namespace` flag as well, for a final installation
command as follows:

```bash
helm upgrade loft vcluster-control-plane --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace
```

## vCluster Platform Values

As with most Helm charts, the vCluster Platform chart supports many user configurable values to modify the
installation. You can find the vCluster Platform chart in the vCluster Platform public repository
[here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart). The `vcluster.yaml` file in the
chart repository contains the default values, as well as many comments showing optional values
and some additional information.

Users can copy the default values file and modify it to suite their deployment needs, or create
a new YAML file containing only the desired values settings. An example values file `myvalues.
yaml` is outlined below.

```yaml
config:
  audit:
    enabled: true
  loftHost: vcluster-platform.mytld.com

ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: vcluster-platform.mytld.com
```

Values files can then be passed to the Helm upgrade command:

```bash
helm upgrade loft vcluster-control-plane --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace \
  --values myvalues.yaml
```

You can provide multiple values files if desired by specifying additional filenames after the
`--values` flag. This can be handy if you like to break up the values sections into different files.

Helm has many additional flags, and other ways to pass values, as always, its a great idea to
check out the Helm [docs](https://helm.sh/docs/) to stay up to date on Helm!

## vCluster Platform Configuration

The vCluster Platform Configuration options (as seen in the vCluster Platform UI `Admin` > `Config` section) are
configurable via vCluster Platform Helm values just like any other deployment options. These values are set
under the `config` section of the chart values, you can see the available configuration options
in the Configuration Section of the docs [here](/platform/installation/configuration/config.mdx).

While all configuration settings are optional, it is always recommended to deploy vCluster Platform with the
`loftHost` configuration set. This config option tells vCluster Platform what its own publicly resolvable
hostname is and is necessary for some integrations, including ArgoCD, and SSO.

## The vCluster Platform Agent

Every connected cluster in a vCluster Platform environment, including the "main" cluster that vCluster Platform is
deployed in, must have a vCluster Platform Agent deployed. This agent pod handles reconciliation of cluster
scoped (as in not vCluster Platform instance wide) resources.

By default, when vCluster Platform is installed, the vCluster Platform pod will _also_ install the vCluster Platform Agent into the
cluster you are deploying vCluster Platform into. This is usually a desirable behavior since vCluster Platform requires
the Agent to be present in all clusters. Sometimes, however, admins wish to manage the
installation of the vCluster Platform Agent themselves, either by installing it explicitly, or by installing
it via GitOps tooling. In this situation, it is possible to disable the Agent deployment by
setting the `DISABLE_AGENT` environment variable to "true". This can be accomplished in the
`env` section of the vCluster Platform values:

```yaml
env:
  DISABLE_AGENT: true
```

It is also possible to tell vCluster Platform not to install Agents into individual clusters -- this can be
accomplished by setting the `loft.sh/cluster-ignore-agent` Annotation of the Cluster resource to
"true" for any clusters that vCluster Platform should _not_ manage the Agent deployment on.

:::warning vCluster Platform Agent Is Required!
The vCluster Platform Agent is _required_ for every connected cluster in a vCluster Platform deployment, this includes the
cluster vCluster Platform itself is deployed into. If you are disabling the agent deployment via one of the
mechanism described above, make sure you are still getting an Agent installed into every
connected cluster by some other means!
:::

If you are electing to manage the Agent installation yourself, you can install the Agent
directly using Helm.

```bash
helm upgrade loft-agent vcluster-control-plane --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace \
  --set agentOnly=true
```

## vCluster Platform Agent Values

As with the primary vCluster Platform chart, the vCluster Platform Agent chart exposes values that can be configured by an
administrator to suit their needs. As with the primary vCluster Platform deployment, the Agent chart and
values can be seen in the public repository
[here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart).

If you have deployed vCluster Platform with the default behavior of _not_ disabling the Agent deployment, you
can still provide values to influence the deployment of the Agent itself. This can be
accomplished by providing any valid Agent values in the `agentValues` section of the _vCluster Platform_
chart values. These values are received by the vCluster Platform deployment and used when deploying the Agent
pods! Below is an example of the vCluster Platform values `agentValues` section.

```yaml
agentValues:
  securityContext:
    enabled: true
```

Administrators can also provide Agent values for _specific clusters_ by setting the `loft.
sh/agent-values` Annotation of a specific cluster object. These values will always override any
values provided in the parent vCluster Platform chart.
