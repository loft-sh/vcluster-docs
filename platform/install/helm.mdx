The platform can be installed directly using Helm commands. Managing the platform installation with Helm directly can be a great way to "GitOps" your platform
installation, by using ArgoCD or other GitOps tools to manage the platform deployment. This section outlines the basics of installing and managing the platform with
Helm, and can serve as a solid starting point for managing the platform
in a GitOps fashion as well.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Helm v3.10+](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/)

The platform installation via Helm is similar to any Helm chart installation. 

### Adding the Loft Helm repository

If you haven't done so, add the Loft Helm repository and update the
Helm repositories.

```bash
helm repo add loft https://charts.loft.sh
helm repo update
```

:::tip
To retrieve all available versions of the vCluster Platform Helm chart, you can
run the following command:

```bash
helm search repo loft-sh/vcluster-platform
```
:::

### Installing the Platform Helm chart

```bash
RELEASE_NAME=vcluster-platform
RELEASE_NAMESPACE=vcluster-platform
PLATFORM_VERSION='' # Set this to a specific version or leave empty to install the latest version

helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME vcluster-platform \
  --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace $RELEASE_NAMESPACE \
  --create-namespace \
  ${PLATFORM_VERSION:+--version $PLATFORM_VERSION}
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
Release "vcluster-platform" does not exist. Installing it now.
NAME: vcluster-platform
LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Oct  4 13:10:52 2024
# highlight-start
NAMESPACE: vcluster-platform
STATUS: deployed
# highlight-end
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
NOTES:
Thank you for installing vcluster-platform.
```

## Values.yaml for the Helm chart

As with most Helm charts, the vcluster-platform chart supports many user configurable values to modify the
deployment of resources. You can find the vcluster-platform chart in the Loft public repository
[here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart). The `values.yaml` file in the
chart repository contains the default values, as well as many comments showing optional values
and some additional information. 

Users can copy the default values file and modify it to suite their deployment needs, or create
a new YAML file containing only the desired values settings. 

### `Config` Field in values.yaml

Inside the values.yaml file, there is a `config` field, which has the configuration options of the platform.
These options are available in the UI under `Admin` > `Config` section and can be edited either through the 
`values.yaml` or the UI. There is a detailed list of [available configuration options](../configure/config.mdx) in our docs.

### Recommended values.yaml 

There are a set of fields in the `values.yaml` that are recommended to explicitly set:

* `config.loftHost` - Sets a publicly resolvable hostname 
* `admin.username` - Sets the username of an admin user. By default, the username is `admin`.
* `admin.password` - Sets the password of an admin user. By default, the username is `password`.


```yaml
admin: 
  username: my-own-username
  password: my-unique-password
config:
  audit:
    enabled: true
  loftHost: vcluster-platform.mytld.com

ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: vcluster-platform.mytld.com
```

### Installing with a `values.yaml`

Values files can be passed to the Helm upgrade command. Update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid vCluster Platform version.

```bash
RELEASE_NAME=vcluster-platform
RELEASE_NAMESPACE=vcluster-platform
PLATFORM_VERSION='' # Set this to a specific version or leave empty to install the latest version

helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME vcluster-platform \
  --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace $RELEASE_NAMESPACE \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values.yaml \
  ${PLATFORM_VERSION:+--version $PLATFORM_VERSION}
```

You can provide multiple values files if desired by specifying additional filenames after the
`--values` flag. This can be handy if you like to break up the values sections into different files.

Helm has many additional flags, and other ways to pass values, as always, its a great idea to
check out the Helm [docs](https://helm.sh/docs/) to stay up to date on Helm.
