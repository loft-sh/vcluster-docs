vCluster Platform can be installed directly via Helm, in fact, even when following the recommend installation
procedure in the Getting Started Guide the vCluster CLI is actually using Helm
to install vCluster Platform.

Managing the vCluster Platform installation with Helm directly can be a great way to "GitOps" your vCluster Platform
installation, by using ArgoCD or other GitOps tools to manage the vCluster Platform deployment via Helm and
appropriate Helm values. This section outlines the basics of installing and managing vCluster Platform with
Helm, and should serve as a solid starting point for managing vCluster Platform
in a GitOps fashion as well.

## Simple Installation

The most basic vCluster Platform installation via Helm looks like any other Helm install command and can be
seen below. Update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid vCluster Platform version.

```bash
helm upgrade [RELASE NAME] vcluster-platform --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --version $PLATFORM_VERSION
```

Typically, users will simply call the release name `vcluster-platform`. If the `vcluster-platform` namespace does not
already exist, you can add the `--create-namespace` flag as well, for a final installation
command. Update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid vCluster Platform version.

```bash
helm upgrade vcluster-platform vcluster-platform --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace \
  --version $PLATFORM_VERSION
```

## vCluster Platform Values

As with most Helm charts, the vCluster Platform chart supports many user configurable values to modify the
installation. You can find the vCluster Platform chart in the vCluster Platform public repository
[here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart). The `values.yaml` file in the
chart repository contains the default values, as well as many comments showing optional values
and some additional information.

Users can copy the default values file and modify it to suite their deployment needs, or create
a new YAML file containing only the desired values settings. An example values file `values.yaml`
is outlined below.

```yaml
config:
  audit:
    enabled: true
  loftHost: vcluster-platform.mytld.com

ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: vcluster-platform.mytld.com
```

Values files can then be passed to the Helm upgrade command. Update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid vCluster Platform version.

```bash
helm upgrade vcluster-platform vcluster-platform --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values.yaml \
  --version $PLATFORM_VERSION
```

You can provide multiple values files if desired by specifying additional filenames after the
`--values` flag. This can be handy if you like to break up the values sections into different files.

Helm has many additional flags, and other ways to pass values, as always, its a great idea to
check out the Helm [docs](https://helm.sh/docs/) to stay up to date on Helm.

## vCluster Platform Configuration

The vCluster Platform Configuration options (as seen in the vCluster Platform UI `Admin` > `Config` section) are
configurable via vCluster Platform Helm values just like any other deployment options. These values are set
under the `config` section of the chart values, you can see the available configuration options
in the Configuration Section of the docs [here](../configure/config.mdx).

While all configuration settings are optional, it is always recommended to deploy vCluster Platform with the
`loftHost` configuration set. This config option tells vCluster Platform what its own publicly resolvable
hostname is and is necessary for some integrations, including ArgoCD, and SSO.
