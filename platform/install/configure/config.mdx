The vCluster Platform config allows you to modify vCluster Platform's behaviour and enable or disable certain features, such as SSO login, custom branding, or auditing.

## Changing vCluster Platform Config

vCluster Platform config can be applied directly via helm values or through the vCluster Platform UI in `Admin` > `Config`. Using helm values allows you to declaratively deploy vCluster Platform.

When using helm you can apply the vCluster Platform config via a `vcluster.yaml` file. This also makes it possible to deploy vCluster Platform through GitOps solutions such as ArgoCD. An example vCluster Platform `vcluster.yaml` could look like this:

```yaml
config:
  loftHost: my-vcluster-host.com
  audit:
    enabled: true
  auth:
    github:
      clientId: $CLIENT_ID
      clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
      redirectURI: https://my-vcluster-host.com/auth/github/callback
```

For a complete overview what helm values are possible, please take a look at the [Loft github repository](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart) directly.

### Changing the Loft Host variable

After setting up the platform and TLS certificates and configuring the ingress to use a custom domain, one should change the `loftHost` variable shown above.
Initially, that value will be set to the URL of either the Loft Router domain or no domain in the case of air-gapped setups.
This value should be equal to the hostname specified in the ingress resource for accessing the platform.

:::info
This value of the `loftHost` variable should only be the hostname that vCluster Platform Platform is reachable at and not contain protocols (such as HTTP) or subpaths.
:::

After changing the `loftHost`, all currently connected clusters must be redeployed by running the same connection commands in the corresponding Kubernetes context.
See the instructions [on connecting Clusters](../../clusters/connect-cluster) for more guidance.

Clusters will also have to be reconnected if the `additionalCA` or `insecureSkipVerify` values are changed after the initial setup.

### Sensitive Information in the vCluster Platform Config

Some fields within the vCluster Platform config allow placeholders for environment variables, such as the `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields. This makes it possible to not expose the sensitive information directly inside the vCluster Platform values and instead mount this information into vCluster Platform through an external secret.

To load the github clientId and clientSecret through a Kubernetes secret `my-secret`, use the following configuration:

```yaml
envValueFrom:
  CLIENT_ID:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: my-secret
      key: client_id
  CLIENT_SECRET:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: my-secret
      key: client_secret

config:
  auth:
    github:
      clientId: $CLIENT_ID
      clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
      redirectURI: https://my-vcluster-platform-host.com/auth/github/callback
```

Then use helm to apply this configuration and update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid vCluster Platform version.

```
helm upgrade loft vcluster-platform --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values.yaml \
  --version $PLATFORM_VERSION
```

### Custom HTTP Headers

vCluster Platform allows you to add custom HTTP headers to all requests that are sent to the vCluster Platform API. This can be useful if you want to add custom headers to all requests, such as `X-Frame-Options` or `X-XSS-Protection`.

To add custom HTTP headers, use the following configuration:

```yaml
config:
  auth:
    customHttpHeaders:
      X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
      X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

### The vCluster Platform Agent

Every connected cluster in a vCluster Platform environment, including the "main" cluster that vCluster Platform is
deployed in, must have a vCluster Platform Agent deployed. This agent pod handles reconciliation of cluster
scoped (as in not vCluster Platform instance wide) resources.

By default, when vCluster Platform is installed, the vCluster Platform pod will _also_ install the vCluster Platform Agent into the
cluster you are deploying vCluster Platform into. This is usually a desirable behavior since vCluster Platform requires
the Agent to be present in all clusters. Sometimes, however, admins wish to manage the
installation of the vCluster Platform Agent themselves, either by installing it explicitly, or by installing
it via GitOps tooling. In this situation, it is possible to disable the Agent deployment by
setting the `DISABLE_AGENT` environment variable to "true". This can be accomplished in the
`env` section of the vCluster Platform values:

```yaml
env:
  DISABLE_AGENT: true
```

It is also possible to tell vCluster Platform not to install Agents into individual clusters -- this can be
accomplished by setting the `loft.sh/cluster-ignore-agent` Annotation of the Cluster resource to
"true" for any clusters that vCluster Platform should _not_ manage the Agent deployment on.

:::warning vCluster Platform Agent Is Required!
The vCluster Platform Agent is _required_ for every connected cluster in a vCluster Platform deployment, this includes the
cluster vCluster Platform itself is deployed into. If you are disabling the agent deployment via one of the
mechanism described above, make sure you are still getting an Agent installed into every
connected cluster by some other means!
:::

If you are electing to manage the Agent installation yourself, you can install the Agent
directly using Helm. Update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a valid vCluster Platform version.

```bash
helm upgrade vcluster-platform vcluster-platform --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace vcluster-platform \
  --create-namespace \
  --set agentOnly=true \
  --version $PLATFORM_VERSION
```

### vCluster Platform Agent Values

As with the primary vCluster Platform chart, the vCluster Platform Agent chart exposes values that can be configured by an
administrator to suit their needs. As with the primary vCluster Platform deployment, the Agent chart and
values can be seen in the public repository
[here](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart).

If you have deployed vCluster Platform with the default behavior of _not_ disabling the Agent deployment, you
can still provide values to influence the deployment of the Agent itself. This can be
accomplished by providing any valid Agent values in the `agentValues` section of the _vCluster Platform_
chart values. These values are received by the vCluster Platform deployment and used when deploying the Agent
pods! Below is an example of the vCluster Platform values `agentValues` section.

```yaml
agentValues:
  securityContext:
    enabled: true
```

Administrators can also provide Agent values for _specific clusters_ by setting the `loft.sh/agent-values` Annotation of a specific cluster object. These values will always override any
values provided in the parent vCluster Platform chart.
