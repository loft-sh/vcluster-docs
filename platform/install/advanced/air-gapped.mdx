This guide walks you through installing vCluster Platform and deploying virtual clusters in environments without internet access, referred to as air-gapped environments. It covers setting up a private OCI-compliant registry, populating it with container images and Helm charts, configuring vCluster Platform and agents to pull from the registry, and deploying virtual clusters securely and offline.

## Prerequisites

- **OCI-compliant private registry with a `/charts` folder** - A private registry accessible to both the Kubernetes cluster for the platform and connected host clusters and a separate, internet-connected machine.
- **An offline license key for vCluster Platform** - A LoftLabs license key is required to install vCluster Platform.
    :::info
    Contact sales@loft.sh to purchase an offline license key or request a trial license key for offline use.
    :::

## Overview

There are several artifacts that are typically accessed using an internet connection. To complete an air-gapped install, these artifacts need to be accessible by the Kubernetes cluster through a private registry.

<!-- vale off -->
- **vCluster Platform Helm chart** - This Helm chart is typically accessed through the LoftLabs charts repository and is used for installing vCluster Platform and connecting hosts (for example installing agents).
- **vCluster Helm chart** - This Helm chart is typically accessed through the LoftLabs charts repository and is used for deploying virtual clusters.
- **Images used in the Helm charts**  - These images are typically accessed through different container registries.

After populating the registry with the artifacts, install vCluster Platform, connect host clusters and then deploy virtual clusters. Each step requires additional configuration to use your private registry.

## Populate images to private registry

Each [vCluster Platform GitHub release](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases) and [vCluster GitHub release](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases) provides multiple release assets to help you upload images to a private registry. These assets include text files listing all necessary images and scripts to automate downloading (pulling) and pushing them.

### Image text files

Each [vCluster Platform release](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases) includes a file that lists all container images required for installing vCluster Platform:

- `images.txt` — Required images for installing vCluster Platform.

In vCluster releases v0.25.0 and later, two files list the container images needed to deploy a vCluster:

- `images.txt` — Required images for deploying vCluster with the default Kubernetes version.
- `images-optional.txt` — Additional images for deploying vCluster with a different Kubernetes version.

In vCluster releases **earlier than v0.25.0**, a single file is provided:

- `vcluster-images.txt` — Required images for deploying vCluster with the default Kubernetes version.

### Scripts to pull and push images

Both product releases contain one script which helps download and package the list of images and another script that pushes images to the private registry. The script from either release can be used
to populate the registry.

The difference between the scripts in the different releases is the default name of the tarball that is created. These instructions override the defaults to ensure the correct image text file and tarball is created.

- `download-images.sh` - A bash script that quickly iterates over all the images files to pull them and package them into a tarball to a machine that has internet access.
- `push-images.sh` - A bash script that takes the tarball generated from the download script to push them to your private registry.

:::tip
Both releases include `download-images.sh` and `push-images.sh`, but you only need to download the scripts once.
:::

### Pull and push images for vCluster Platform

Download the required platform images from public registries and upload them to your private registry for air-gapped installation.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to the internet
- Ability to push to your OCI-compliant private registry
- Logged in to GitHub Container Registry
- `wget` installed
- `docker` installed

#### Populate the registry with images

Follow these steps to populate the registry with the required platform images.

<Flow id="offline-platform-images">
  <Step>

  Set environment variables for the version of vCluster Platform that you want to deploy and the private registry.

        ```bash title="Export environment variables"
        export PLATFORM_VERSION=4.3.0 # Replace with desired version
        export REGISTRY=ecr.io/myteam # This should be a prefix; do not include any image paths
        ```
  </Step>
  <Step>

  Download the assets from the [vCluster Platform GitHub release](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases) and make the scripts executable.

  :::warning
  The `images.txt` contains a `vcluster-pro` image for the default vCluster version, but doesn't contain all the images required
  to deploy vCluster. An additional step is required to retrieve all vCluster images.
  :::

  ```bash title="Download assets and prepare scripts"
  wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${PLATFORM_VERSION}/loft-images.txt
  wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${PLATFORM_VERSION}/download-images.sh
  wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${PLATFORM_VERSION}/push-images.sh

  chmod +x ./download-images.sh
  chmod +x ./push-images.sh
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>

  Run `download-images.sh` to pull all images and create a tarball of the images.

  Review the output to confirm all images were pulled successfully and packaged in the tarball.

  ```bash title="Download and package images"
  ./download-images.sh --image-list loft-images.txt --images loft-images.tar.gz
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>

  Run `push-images.sh` to upload all required images to your private registry.

  When pushing images to your private registry, references to the original (public) image registry are removed. Only the image name and repository are preserved. This enables vCluster to pull all images from your configured private registry.

  ```bash title="Push images to private registry"
  ./push-images.sh --registry ${REGISTRY} --images loft-images.tar.gz
  ```

  </Step>
</Flow>


### Pull and push images for vCluster

Follow these steps to populate the registry with the specific images needed for deploying vCluster.

<Flow id="offline-vcluster-images">
  <Step>

  Set environment variables for the version of vCluster that you want to deploy and the private registry.

  :::tip
  You can review the `tag` of the `vcluster-pro` image in
  `images.txt` to pick the default vCluster version.
  :::

    ```bash title="Export environment variables"
    export VCLUSTER_VERSION=0.25.0 # Replace with desired version
    # Setting the REGISTRY environment is redundant from the steps in populating vCluster Platform images
    # export REGISTRY=ecr.io/myteam # This should be a prefix; do not include any image paths
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>

  Download the text files from the [vCluster GitHub release](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases).

  The `images.txt` or `vcluster-images.txt` files contain multiple Kubernetes versions and distributions. You can edit the file and remove the images for any unwanted versions and distributions.

  ```bash title="Download image text file for vCluster v0.25.0+ versions"
  wget https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases/download/v${VCLUSTER_VERSION}/images.txt
  ```

  ```bash title="Download image text file for vCluster < v0.25.0 versions"
  wget https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases/download/v${VCLUSTER_VERSION}/vClusterimages.txt
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>

  **Optional**: Download the scripts from the [vCluster GitHub release](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases) and make them executable.

  :::note
  If you've already completed this as part of populating the platform images, you can skip this step.
  :::

  ```bash title="Download prepare scripts"
   wget https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases/download/v${VCLUSTER_VERSION}/download-images.sh
   wget https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases/download/v${VCLUSTER_VERSION}/push-images.sh
   chmod +x ./download-images.sh
   chmod +x ./push-images.sh
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>

  Run `download-images.sh` to pull all images and create a tarball of the images.

  Review the output to confirm all images were pulled successfully and packaged in the tarball.

  ```bash title="Download and package images for vCluster v0.25.0+ versions"
  ./download-images.sh --image-list images.txt --images vcluster-images.tar.gz
  ```

    ```bash title="Download and package images for vCluster < v0.25.0 versions"
  ./download-images.sh --image-list vcluster-images.txt --images vcluster-images.tar.gz
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>

  Run `push-images.sh` to upload all required images to your private registry.

  Images are pushed to your private registry without public registry references, preserving only the repository and image name.
  You can configure vCluster to use your private registry for all deployments.

  ```bash title="Push images to private registry"
  ./push-images.sh --registry ${REGISTRY} --images vcluster-images.tar.gz
  ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  **Optional**: If you want to deploy vCluster v0.25.0 or later with a different Kubernetes version, download the `images-optional.txt` file from the [vCluster GitHub release](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases). Additional container images for the version must be downloaded and uploaded to your private registry.

  The `images-optional.txt` contains multiple Kubernetes distributions and versions. You can edit the file and remove the images for the unwanted distributions and versions.

    ```bash title "Pull, package, and push all optional images"
    wget https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases/download/v${VCLUSTER_VERSION}/images-optional.txt
    ./download-images.sh --image-list images-optional.txt --images vcluster-images-optional.tar.gz
    ./push-images.sh --registry ${REGISTRY} --images vcluster-images-optional.tar.gz
    ```

  </Step>
</Flow>

## Populate the Helm charts to a private registry

You can push the following Helm charts to your OCI-compliant private registry:

- **vCluster Platform Helm chart**: The core chart for deploying the vCluster platform.
- **Version-specific Helm charts**: Charts required for each vCluster version you intend to deploy.
- **Application Helm charts**: Charts for applications you plan to deploy with vCluster. See [Apps documentation](../../understand/what-are-apps) for details.
- **Experimental configuration charts**: Charts needed when using `experimental.deploy.vcluster.helm` [configuration settings](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster).

:::warning
Detailed steps are only provided for how to pull and push the vCluster Platform and vCluster Helm chart.
:::

#### Prerequisites

- Access to the internet
- Ability to push to your OCI-compliant private registry
- `helm` installed: Helm v3.10+

### Pull and push the vCluster Platform Helm chart

<Flow id="offline-platform-helm-chart">
  <Step>

  :::note
  If you haven’t already set the environment variables, set them now before continuing.
  :::

  The private registry requires a `/charts` folder, where you must push all Helm charts.

   ```bash title="Export environment variables"
   export PLATFORM_VERSION=4.3.0 # Replace with desired version
   export REGISTRY=ecr.io/myteam # A charts folder is expected
   ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
  Pull the platform Helm chart and push it to your private registry with the OCI protocol:

  ```bash title="Pull and push the Helm chart to your private registry"
  helm pull vcluster-platform --repo https://charts.loft.sh --version ${PLATFORM_VERSION}
  helm push vcluster-platform-${PLATFORM_VERSION}.tgz oci://${REGISTRY}/charts
  ```
  </Step>
</Flow>

### Pull and push the vCluster Helm chart

<Flow id="offline-helm-chart">
  <Step>

  :::note
  If you haven’t already set the environment variables, set them now before continuing.
  :::

 The private registry assumes having a `/charts` folder, which is where to push all the Helm charts.

   ```bash title="Export environment variables"
   export VCLUSTER_VERSION=0.25.0 # Replace with desired version
   export REGISTRY=ecr.io/myteam # A charts folder is expected
   ```

  </Step>
   <Step>
  Pull the vCluster Helm chart and push it into your private registry with the OCI protocol.

  ```bash title="Pull and push the Helm chart to your private registry"
  helm pull vcluster --repo https://charts.loft.sh --version ${VCLUSTER_VERSION}
  helm push vcluster-${VCLUSTER_VERSION}.tgz oci://${REGISTRY}/charts
  ```
  </Step>
</Flow>

## Configure and install vCluster Platform and agent {#configure-install-platform-agent}

To install the platform and connect hosts, you must configure a `vcluster-platform.yaml` file.
This YAML file is used as the `values.yaml` for the vCluster Platform Helm chart.

### Prerequisites

- The cluster must have access to pull the **vCluster Platform images** from the private registry.
<BasePrerequisites />
- vCluster Platform Pod Resource Requirements

  - Requests
    - memory: `256Mi`
    - cpu: `200m`
  - Limits
    - memory: `4Gi`
    - cpu: `2`

<NetworkPorts />

### vCluster Platform and agent configuration

The `vcluster-platform.yaml` file contains all configuration settings for your vCluster Platform and connected hosts (agents) installation.

<details>
  <summary>Reference the offline license key</summary>

Reference the license key so that the platform can start with all your enterprise features enabled.

```yaml title="Offline license configuration"
env:
  LICENSE_KEY: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Use a private registry without credentials</summary>

- Set the **image** to be used by the vCluster Platform Helm chart to the image in the private registry.
- Set the **default registry** for pulling images used in installing vCluster Platform or connecting hosts (i.e. deploying agents).
- Set the **default chart registry** in the `vcluster-platform.yaml` as the
default Helm repository when creating virtual clusters. This should prefix with `oci://` to ensure it's being
deployed using OCI protocol as well as the `/charts` folder.

```yaml title="Setting the image for vCluster Platform and the default  private registry"
image: ecr.io/myteam/loft-sh/vcluster-platform:<PLATFORM_VERSION> # Replace with the fully formed image name based on your private registry

env:
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY: ecr.io/myteam
  DEFAULT_VCLUSTER_CHART_REPO: oci://ecr.io/myteam/charts

# The agent values are needed to keep the agent up to date with the same settings
agentValues:
  env:
    DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY: ecr.io/myteam
    DEFAULT_VCLUSTER_CHART_REPO: oci://ecr.io/myteam/charts
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Use an authenticated private registry</summary>

- Set the **image** to be used by the vCluster Platform Helm chart to the image in the private registry.
- Set the **default registry** for pulling images used in installing vCluster Platform or connecting hosts (i.e. deploying agents).
- Set the **default chart registry** in the `vcluster-platform.yaml` as the
default Helm repository when creating virtual clusters. This should prefix with `oci://` to ensure it's being
deployed using OCI protocol as well as the `/charts` folder.
- For registries that require authentication, create a Kubernetes secret in the namespace where you deploy the vCluster Platform or agent.
- Reference the **secret** to use those credentials for the registries.

```yaml title="Setting the image for vCluster Platform and the default  private registry"
image: ecr.io/myteam/loft-sh/vcluster-platform:v<PLATFORM_VERSION> # Replace with the fully formed image name based on your private registry

env:
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY: ecr.io/myteam
  DEFAULT_VCLUSTER_CHART_REPO: oci://ecr.io/myteam/charts
  HELM_REGISTRY_CONFIG: /loft/helm/.dockerconfigjson

volumes:
  - name: helm-pull-secret
    secret:
      secretName: registry-credentials-secret-name # Replace with the name of the secret deployed on the host cluster of where the Platform is deployed

volumeMounts:
  - name: helm-pull-secret
    mountPath: /loft/helm
    readOnly: true

# The agent values are needed to keep the agent up to date with the same settings
agentValues:
  env:
    DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY: ecr.io/myteam

  volumeMounts:
  - name: helm-pull-secret
    mountPath: /loft/helm
    readOnly: true
```

:::warning
This only configures the registry authentication for managing virtual clusters with Helm.
- See [App Reference](../../api/resources/apps#app-reference) to configure the chart [repository URL](../../api/resources/apps#spec-config-chart-repoURL) with [username](../../api/resources/apps#spec-config-chart-usernameRef) and [password](../../api/resources/apps#spec-config-chart-passwordRef) authentication.
- See `experimental.deploy.vcluster.helm` [configuration](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster) to configure [repository](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster-helm-chart-repo) with [username](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster-helm-chart-username) and [password](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster-helm-chart-password) authentication.
:::

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Use different vCluster Platform login credentials</summary>

If the username and password are not set in your `vcluster-platform.yaml`, the default credentials are:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `my-password`

```yaml title="Set different vCluster Platform login credentials"
admin:
  create: true
  username: newadmin
  password: "newpassword"
```

</details>

### Install the platform {#install-platform}

It is recommended to install vCluster Platform on its own host cluster.

#### Prerequisites
- The machine that is running the install commands must have access to pull the Helm chart from the private registry.
- The host cluster where the vCluster Platform is being installed on must have access to pull images from the private registry.
<BasePrerequisites />

#### Install vCluster Platform {#install-vcluster-platform}

<Flow id="install-vcluster-platform">
  <Step>
  On the host cluster, create the namespace for the platform, where vCluster Platform and optionally login credentials are to be deployed in.

  ```bash title="Create vCluster Platform namespace"
  export PLATFORM_NAMESPACE=vcluster-platform
  kubectl create namespace ${PLATFORM_NAMESPACE}
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
  **Optional**: create a secret to authenticate to your private registry.

  If your private registry requires authentication, create a Kubernetes secret that stores your login credentials.
  Place this secret in the same namespace where the vCluster Platform is deployed. There are multiple ways to create your registry credentials as a secret.

  Read more about how to quickly create a [secret from your docker login](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_create/kubectl_create_secret_docker-registry/).

  ```bash title="Example of how to create a Kubernetes secret for login credentials"
  kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-credentials-secret-name \
    --namespace ${PLATFORM_NAMESPACE} \
    --docker-server=<your-registry-server> \
    --docker-username=<your-username> \
    --docker-password=<your-password> \
    --docker-email=<your-email>
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>

  Deploy vCluster Platform into the same namespace.

  ```bash title="Deploy vCluster with Helm"
  export PLATFORM_VERSION=4.3.0 # Replace with the chart version that was pushed into your private registry
  export REGISTRY=myecr.io/team # Replace with the private registry

  helm upgrade --install vcluster-platform oci://${REGISTRY}/charts/vcluster-platform:${PLATFORM_VERSION} \
    --version ${PLATFORM_VERSION} \
    --values vcluster-platform.yaml \
    --namespace ${PLATFORM_NAMESPACE}
  ```

  </Step>

</Flow>

### Connect host clusters

After installing the platform, connect host clusters by deploying an agent on each host. The host clusters must be able to access the domain where vCluster Platform is hosted.

Deploying an agent is deploying the vCluster Platform Helm chart and `vcluster-platform.yaml`.  The only difference is when deploying the vCluster Platform Helm
chart is adding additional variables to figure out how to connect to the platform.

#### Prerequisites

- The machine that is running the install commands must have access to pull the Helm chart from the private registry.
- The host cluster where the vCluster Platform is being installed on must have access to pull images from the private registry.
<BasePrerequisites />

#### Deploy agents to connect host clusters

<Flow id="install-agent">
  <Step>
  On the host cluster, create the namespace for the agent installation, where the agent and optionally login credentials are to be deployed in.

  ```bash title="Create vCluster Platform namespace"
  export AGENT_NAMESPACE=vcluster-platform
  kubectl create namespace ${AGENT_NAMESPACE}
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
  **Optional**: Create a Secret to authenticate with your private registry.

  If your private registry requires authentication, create a Kubernetes Secret that stores your login credentials.
  Place this secret in the same namespace where the agent is deployed. There are multiple ways to create your registry credentials as a Secret.

  For more details, see [Create a Secret from your Docker login](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_create/kubectl_create_secret_docker-registry/).

  ```bash title=" Create a Kubernetes secret for login credentials example"
  kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-credentials-secret-name \
    --namespace ${AGENT_NAMESPACE} \
    --docker-server=<your-registry-server> \
    --docker-username=<your-username> \
    --docker-password=<your-password> \
    --docker-email=<your-email>
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>

  Deploy the agent into the same namespace.

  ```bash title="Deploy vCluster with Helm"
  export PLATFORM_VERSION=4.3.0 # Replace with the chart version that was pushed into your private registry
  export REGISTRY=myecr.io/team # Replace with the private registry

  export PLATFORM_DOMAIN=https://myvclusterplatform.com
  export PLATFORM_TOKEN=<YOUR_PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN>

  helm upgrade --install vcluster-platform oci://${REGISTRY}/charts/vcluster-platform:${PLATFORM_VERSION} \
    --version ${PLATFORM_VERSION} \
    --values vcluster-platform.yaml \
    --namespace ${AGENT_NAMESPACE} \
    --set agentOnly=true \
    --set url=$PLATFORM_DOMAIN \
    --set token=$PLATFORM_TOKEN
  ```

  </Step>
</Flow>

## Configure and deploy virtual clusters {#configure-deploy-virtual-clusters}

#### Prerequisites

Before deploying a virtual cluster, ensure the following:

- The host cluster must have access to pull vCluster images from the private registry.

### Virtual cluster configuration {#virtual-cluster-configuration}

The `vcluster.yaml` file defines all configuration settings for your virtual cluster deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Use a private registry without credentials</summary>

Set the default private registry that does **not** have authentication.

```yaml title="Setting the private registry"
controlPlane:
 advanced:
   defaultImageRegistry: ecr.io/myteam # Replace with your private registry
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Use an authenticated private registry</summary>

For registries that require authentication, create a Kubernetes secret in the namespace where you deploy the vCluster.
Assign the secret as an image pull secret for the vCluster control plane to access required images.

Optionally, you can use the same image pull secret for workloads inside the vCluster that pull from the same registry.

```yaml title="Image pull secrets configuration"
controlPlane:
  advanced:
    defaultImageRegistry: ecr.io/myteam # Replace with your private image registry
    serviceAccount:
      imagePullSecrets: # Uses credentials for the vCluster control plane
        - name: registry-credentials-secret-name # Replace with the name of the secret deployed on the host cluster of where the vCluster is deployed
    workloadServiceAccount: # Uses credentials for any workloads created in the vCluster
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: registry-credentials-secret-name # Replace with the name of the secret deployed on the host cluster of where your vCluster is deployed
```

:::warning
When using virtual clusters in air-gapped environments, the
`config.experimental.deploy.vcluster.helm` [configuration setting](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster) does not work with external Helm repositories since they cannot be accessed. This means custom Helm charts from repositories like `charts.bitnami.com` cannot be used for virtual cluster deployments.
:::

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Use a non-default Kubernetes version</summary>

For vCluster v0.25.0+, if you downloaded `images-optional.txt` to use a different Kubernetes version, configure vCluster to use that version in your deployment.

```yaml title="Specific Kubernetes version configuration"
controlPlane:
  distro:
    k8s:
      image:
        tag: v1.31.1 # Replace with the Kubernetes version that you have chosen
```

For other versions, refer to the vCluster docs on how to set your image versions.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Replace the alpine image</summary>

If you use the `sync.toHost.pods.rewriteHosts` feature, manually replace the full path of the [alpine image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) with your private registry path.
The `defaultImageRegistry` setting does not apply to this image.

```yaml title="Replace the alpine image"
sync:
  toHost:
    pods:
      rewriteHosts:
        initContainer:
          image: ecr.io/myteam/library/alpine:3.20
```

</details>

### Deploy vCluster through the platform

When deploying vCluster through the platform console, you must add your `vcluster.yaml`.

#### Use an authenticated private registry

If you are using a private registry with authentication, you must create a Kubernetes secret that stores your login credentials.  Place this secret in the same namespace where the vCluster is deployed so the control plane can pull the required container images.

In the options for the config, there is a section called `Host namespace`, add the yaml for the secret in the `Kubernetes objects` section.

  ```yaml title="Kubernetes secret for login credentials"
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: registry-credentials-secret-name
    namespace: ${VCLUSTER_NAMESPACE}
  type: Opaque
  data:
    # Credentials based on your private registry
  ```

### Deploy vCluster using Helm

#### Prerequisites

<BasePrerequisites />

<Flow>
  <Step>

  In the platform UI, create an [access key](../../administer/users-permissions/access-keys) to connect vCluster to the platform. Save the **access key**.

  </Step>
  <Step>

  Create a Kubernetes secret using the **access key** in a namespace on the host cluster.

 ```bash title="Create platform API key namespace and secret for platform API key"
  export APIKEY_NAMESPACE=api-key-namespace
  kubectl create namespace ${APIKEY_NAMESPACE}


  kubectl create -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: vcluster-platform-api-key
    namespace: ${APIKEY_NAMESPACE}
  type: Opaque
  data:
    accessKey: # Access key from the Platform UI
    host: # domain name of platform
    insecure: # ???
  EOF
```

  </Step>

  <Step>
  **Optional**: Create a secret to authenticate to your private registry.

  If your private registry requires authentication, create a Kubernetes secret that stores your login credentials.
  Place this secret in the same namespace where the vCluster is deployed so the control plane can pull the required container images.

  ```bash title="Create Kubernetes secret for login credentials"
  export VCLUSTER_NAMESPACE=vcluster-my-vcluster  # Replace with the name of the namespace you want to deploy your vCluster into
  kubectl create namespace ${VCLUSTER_NAMESPACE}

  kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-credentials-secret-name \
  --namespace ${VCLUSTER_NAMESPACE} \
  --docker-server=<your-registry-server> \
  --docker-username=<your-username> \
  --docker-password=<your-password> \
  --docker-email=<your-email>
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
  Review your `vcluster.yaml` file.

  ```yaml title="vcluster.yaml configuration"
  controlPlane:
    advanced:
      defaultImageRegistry: ecr.io/myteam # Replace with your private image registry
      serviceAccount:
        imagePullSecrets:
          - name: registry-credentials-secret-name # Replace with the name of the registry credentials secret
