If your cluster is air-gapped, within a VPC, or has restricted network connectivity, you may encounter issues validating the platform license and pulling required container images.

To solve the licensing issue, you can either use allow HTTP requests from
the platform pods to
`https://admin.loft.sh/*` (this is the preferred option), or use an
[offline license key](#offline-license-key).

To address image pulling issues from Docker Hub, you can [use a private image
registry](#offline-images) to host your own copies of the platform images
accessible to your cluster.

To address pulling Helm charts from external chart registries, you can use an [OCI compatible private image registry](#offline-helm-charts) to
host Helm charts.

## Prerequisites

<BasePrerequisites />

-  A private Docker registry accessible to both the installer computer and the air-gapped Kubernetes cluster

### Optional prerequisites

- On the installation computer:
  - `docker` (verify with `docker version`)
  - An offline license key for the platform (provided by Loft)

### Supported Kubernetes versions

- A running air-gapped Kubernetes cluster with one of the [supported versions](/docs/vcluster/deploy/upgrade/supported_versions#kubernetes-compatibility-matrix)

:::note
Although the platform might work with other versions, using the supported versions is recommended to avoid potential issues.
:::

### Resource requirements

- Pod Resource Requirements:

  - Requests
    - memory: `256Mi`
    - cpu: `200m`
  - Limits
    - memory: `4Gi`
    - cpu: `2`

<NetworkPorts />


## Deployment

### Offline images

For clusters unable to pull images from Docker Hub, you must push the platform images to your private registry. Each platform release includes a `loft-images.txt` file that lists the necessary images.

:::warning
When using virtual clusters in air-gapped environments, the
`config.experimental.deploy.vcluster.helm` [configuration setting](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster) does not work with external Helm repositories since they cannot be accessed. This means custom Helm charts from repositories like `charts.bitnami.com` cannot be used for virtual cluster deployments.
:::

Follow these instructions to download all platform images and import them to your private registry:

<Flow id="offline-images">
    <Step>
        <PartialAdminSetVersion/>
  </Step>
  <Step>

Set your private registry as a variable:

```bash title="Set private registry"
REGISTRY=ecr.io/myteam      # This should be a prefix; do not include any LOFT_IMAGE paths
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Download the `loft-images.txt` file and the required scripts `download-images.sh` and `push-images.sh`, then make them executable:

```bash title="Download and prepare scripts"
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/loft-images.txt
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/download-images.sh
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/push-images.sh

chmod +x ./download-images.sh
chmod +x ./push-images.sh
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Run `download-images.sh` to download all images locally:

```bash title="Download images"
./download-images.sh --image-list loft-images.txt
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Run `push-images.sh` to push all downloaded images to your private registry:

```bash title="Push images to private registry"
./push-images.sh --registry ${REGISTRY}
```

    </Step>
    <Step>

Edit your existing `vcluster-platform.yaml` file or create a new one with the following content:

```yaml title="vcluster-platform.yaml"
image: ${REGISTRY}/ghcr.io/loft-sh/loft:${VERSION} # Replace ${REGISTRY} and ${VERSION}
env:
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY: ${REGISTRY} # Replace ${REGISTRY}
```

:::info Example of a fully formed registry path
If your `REGISTRY` is set to `ecr.io/myteam`, a fully formed registry path might look like:
`ecr.io/myteam/ghcr.io/loft-sh/loft:3.0.0`

### Offline Helm charts

For clusters unable to pull Helm charts from external chart repositories, it is recommended to use an OCI compatible
private image registry to host the required Helm charts.

Follow these instructions to configure the platform and import the required Helm charts to your private registry:

<Flow id="offline-charts">
<Step>
Set your private registry as a variable:

```bash title="Set private OCI registry"
CHART_REGISTRY=oci://ecr.io/myteam/charts      # The OCI prefix is required for Helm
```
</Step>

<Step>
Make a list of Helm Charts to be used in the platform. Be sure to include:
- Helm charts for each vCluster to be used when creating virtual clusters
[manually](../../use-platform/virtual-clusters/create/create-no-template) or with a [template](../../use-platform/virtual-clusters/create/create-with-template).
- Helm charts to be used with [apps](../../understand/what-are-apps)
- Helm charts to be used in virtual cluster `experimental.deploy.vcluster.helm` [configuration](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster)

:::note
Each platform version supports a default vCluster version that works immediately. While you can use this default version, we recommend importing the vCluster Helm chart to ensure compatibility after platform upgrades.
:::

</Step>

<Step>
Run the follow command to pull each required Helm chart as a local `*.tgz` file. The `vcluster` chart is shown as an example:

```bash title="Pull the vcluster Helm chart"
helm pull vcluster --repo https://charts.loft.sh --version ${VERSION} # Replace ${VERSION}
```
</Step>

<Step>
Run the follow command to push each Helm chart's `*.tgz` file to your OCI registry. The `vcluster` chart is shown as an example:

```bash title="Push the vcluster Helm chart to private registry"
helm push vcluster-${VERSION}.tgz ${CHART_REGISTRY} # Replace ${VERSION}
```
</Step>

<Step>
To configure the platform to use your private registry as the default Helm repository when creating virtual clusters, edit your existing
`vcluster-platform.yaml` file or create a new one with the following content:
```yaml title="vcluster-platform.yaml"
env:
  DEFAULT_VCLUSTER_CHART_REPO: ${CHART_REGISTRY} # Replace ${CHART_REGISTRY}
```
</Step>

<Step>
If your OCI registry requires authentication, the platform can be configured to use an image pull
secret for authenticating the `helm` command. Add this to your `vcluster-platform.yaml`:
```yaml title="vcluster-platform.yaml"
volumes:
  - name: helm-pull-secret
    secret:
      secretName: ${IMAGE_PULL_SECRET} # Replace with the name of your image pull secret
volumeMounts:
  - name: helm-pull-secret
    mountPath: /loft/helm
    readOnly: true
env:
  HELM_REGISTRY_CONFIG: /loft/helm/.dockerconfigjson
```

:::warning
This only configures the platform authentication for managing virtual clusters with Helm.
- See [App Reference](../../api/resources/apps#app-reference) to configure the chart [repository URL](../../api/resources/apps#spec-config-chart-repoURL) with [username](../../api/resources/apps#spec-config-chart-usernameRef) and [password](../../api/resources/apps#spec-config-chart-passwordRef) authentication.
- See `experimental.deploy.vcluster.helm` [configuration](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster) to configure [repository](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster-helm-chart-repo) with [username](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster-helm-chart-username) and [password](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/#experimental-deploy-vcluster-helm-chart-password) authentication.

## Configuration

#### Offline license key

If your cluster does not allow the platform pod to connect to the platform license server (`https://admin.loft.sh/*`), contact [sales@loft.sh](mailto:sales@loft.sh) to purchase an offline license key or request a trial license key for offline use.

Edit the platform install values as follows to use your offline license key:

```yaml title="Offline license configuration"
env:
  LICENSE_KEY: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
```

:::info
Apply this configuration during the initial installation process or when upgrading the platform. Include it in your `vcluster-platform.yaml` file or pass it as a value to the Helm install or upgrade command.
