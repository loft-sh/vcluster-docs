vcluster:
  term: "vCluster"
  definition: "An open-source software product that creates and manages virtual Kubernetes clusters inside a host Kubernetes cluster. vCluster improves isolation and multi-tenancy capabilities while reducing infrastructure costs."
  related: ["virtual-cluster", "host-cluster"]
  type: "vcluster"

virtual-cluster:
  term: "virtual cluster"
  definition: "A certified Kubernetes distribution that runs as an isolated, virtual environment nested inside a physical host cluster. Virtual clusters run inside host cluster namespaces but operate as independent Kubernetes environments, each with its own API server, control plane, syncer, and set of resources."
  related: ["vcluster", "host-cluster"]
  type: "vcluster"
  
host-cluster:
  term: "host cluster"
  definition: "The physical Kubernetes cluster where virtual clusters are deployed and run. The host cluster provides the infrastructure resources (CPU, memory, storage, networking) that virtual clusters leverage, while maintaining isolation between different virtual environments."
  related: ["virtual-cluster"]
  type: "vcluster"

syncer:
  term: "syncer"
  definition: "A component in vCluster that synchronizes resources between the virtual cluster and the host cluster, enabling virtual clusters to function while maintaining isolation."
  related: ["vcluster", "virtual-cluster"]
  type: "vcluster"
  url: "/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/"

multi-tenancy:
  term: "multi-tenancy"
  definition: "The capability to host multiple separate users, teams, or workloads on the same infrastructure while providing isolation between them. Virtual clusters enhance multi-tenancy in Kubernetes environments."
  related: ["virtual-cluster"]
  type: "vcluster"

k3s:
  term: "K3s"
  definition: "A lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution often used as the default distribution for virtual clusters due to its minimal resource requirements and fast startup time."
  related: ["k8s", "k0s"]
  type: "vcluster"

k8s:
  term: "K8s"
  definition: "The standard Kubernetes distribution that can be used in virtual clusters, offering full compatibility with upstream Kubernetes features."
  related: ["k3s", "k0s"]
  type: "vcluster"

k0s:
  term: "K0s"
  definition: "A lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution that can be used in virtual clusters as an alternative to K3s or standard Kubernetes."
  related: ["k3s", "k8s"] 
  type: "vcluster"

platform:
  term: "the platform"

  related: ["project", "virtual-cluster", "vcluster"]
  type: "platform"
  
project:
  term: "project"
  definition: "A logical grouping of resources in the platform that provides team isolation and resource quotas. Projects help organize virtual clusters and namespace resources."
  related: ["platform", "team"]

team:
  term: "team"
  definition: "A group of users in the platform with shared access to specific projects and resources."

namespace:
  term: "namespace"
  definition: "A Kubernetes namespace that can be managed by the platform, providing isolation for resources within a cluster."
