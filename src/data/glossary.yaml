vcluster:
  term: "vCluster"
  definition: "An open-source software product that creates and manages virtual Kubernetes clusters inside a host Kubernetes cluster. vCluster improves isolation and multi-tenancy capabilities while reducing infrastructure costs."
  related: ["virtual-cluster", "host-cluster"]
  type: "vcluster"

virtual-cluster:
  term: "Virtual Cluster"
  definition: "A certified Kubernetes distribution that runs as an isolated, virtual environment nested inside a physical host cluster. Virtual clusters run inside host cluster namespaces but operate as independent Kubernetes environments, each with its own API server, control plane, syncer, and set of resources."
  related: ["vcluster", "host-cluster"]
  type: "vcluster"

host-cluster:
  term: "Host Cluster"
  definition: "The physical Kubernetes cluster where virtual clusters are deployed and run. The host cluster provides the infrastructure resources (CPU, memory, storage, networking) that virtual clusters leverage, while maintaining isolation between different virtual environments."
  related: ["virtual-cluster"]
  type: "vcluster"

syncer:
  term: "Syncer"
  definition: "A component in vCluster that synchronizes resources between the virtual cluster and the host cluster, enabling virtual clusters to function while maintaining isolation."

multi-tenancy:
  term: "Multi-tenancy"
  definition: "The capability to host multiple separate users, teams, or workloads on the same infrastructure while providing isolation between them. Virtual clusters enhance multi-tenancy in Kubernetes environments."
