# Native sleep mode

:::warning
Native sleep mode is intended for pre-production use cases only, and comes with some limitations and
caveats and should not be enabled on virtual clusters that are using the current sleep mode configuration found in
[external.platform](../external/platform).
:::

Not all workloads need to run all the time, and scaling them down saves time and money. With vCluster-native sleep mode you can scale down workloads based on a set schedule, or activity from users and ingress. 

## Enable native sleep mode

To enable vCluster-native sleep mode, use the following configuration inside your `vcluster.yaml`:

```yaml title="native sleep mode configuration"
experimental:
  sleepMode:
    enabled: true
    autoSleep:
      afterInactivity: 1h
```

## How it works

### Sleep mode operations

Sleep mode performs two main operations:

**Sleeping**
Deletes bare pods and scales down the following resources:
- Deployments
- ReplicaSets
- ReplicationControllers
- DaemonSets

**Waking**

- Scales resources back to their original state
- Cannot restore previously deleted bare pods

### Resource exemption

Resources can be exempted from sleep mode using either:
- Adding the annotation `sleepmode.loft.sh/exclude: true`
- Configuring `sleepMode` with specific labels
- Adding configured labels to workloads that should keep running

## Detecting activity

To wake a sleeping cluster or to update the last active time, native sleep mode captures the following:

- Access of cluster resources through API calls (e.g., `kubectl get <resource>`)
- Attempts to contact Ingress endpoints (NGINX only)

:::note
Ingress activity detection is only available for [NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main)
ingress controllers, making use of the [mirror-target](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#mirror)
annotation.  This has the effect of overwriting any previously set mirror-target annotation.
:::

## Ingress configuration

### Sync to host

If you install your ingress controllers in the vCluster you'll need to exempt the controller from sleeping so it remains
active for requests that would wake the vCluster.  If you install the `Ingress` controller in the host cluster, you'll need to
enable syncing ingresses to the host.

```yaml title="enable ingress syncing"
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```

### Reachability

For proper ingress activity detection:
- The vCluster pod must be discoverable by the ingress controller
- DNS lookup for `<vcluster-namespace>.<vcluster-svc-name>.svc.cluster.local` must resolve
- Proper `dnsPolicy` configuration in the ingress controller Helm installation

## Examples

The below examples demonstrate how to configure sleep mode in a virtual cluster.
Please make sure to install the necessary prerequisites before proceeding.

### Prerequisites

<BasePrerequisites />

- `vCluster`: vCluster command-line tool to provision and manage virtual clusters.
  <InstallCli />
- `docker`: Container runtime [installation guide](https://www.docker.com/).
- `kind`: Kubernetes in Docker [installation guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).
- `curl`: Command-line tool for transferring data (pre-installed on most systems, see [installation guide](https://curl.se/) if needed)

```yaml title="Sleep after 3 hours of inactivity, anything that does not have the label dont=sleep"
experimental:
  sleepMode:
    enabled: true
    autoSleep:
      afterInactivity: 3h  # Uses Go's Duration with a max unit of hour
      exclude:
        selector:
          labels:
            dont: sleep
```

```yaml title="Sleep every Friday at 17:30 and wake every Monday at 7:00 in Mountain timezone"
experimental:
  sleepMode:
    enabled: true
    timezone: America/Denver
    autoSleep:
      schedule: 30 17 * * 5
      wakeup:
        schedule: 0 7 * * 1
```
