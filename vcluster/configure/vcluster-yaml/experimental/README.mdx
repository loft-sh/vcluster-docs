### Available features

- **[Deploy](./deploy.mdx)** - Configure deployment settings for experimental features
- **[Isolated Control Plane](./isolated-control-plane.mdx)** - Run vCluster with an isolated control plane
- **[Sync Settings](./sync-settings.mdx)** - Advanced synchronization configuration
- **[Deny Proxy Requests](./deny-proxy-requests.mdx)** - Block proxy requests to the host cluster
- **[Virtual Cluster KubeConfig](./virtual-cluster-kubeconfig.mdx)** - Customize virtual cluster kubeconfig generation

### Configure experimental features

Experimental features are configured under the `experimental` section of your vCluster configuration. These features may change between releases, so use them with caution in production environments.
