This provides a way to connect directly to the vCluster Platform.

## Connect virtual clusters to the vCluster Platform 

To connect a virtual cluster to the vCluster Platform, you can use an API keyâ€”referred to as an [access key](/platform/next/api/authentication) in the platform's UI. There are two authentication methods:

- **Shared access key** (Recommended): Create a single Kubernetes Secret containing the access key, and reference it in multiple virtual clusters, even if they are deployed in different namespaces. This approach simplifies management, reduces overhead, and eases credential rotation, making it suitable for most users and production environments.

- **Individual access keys**: Create separate Kubernetes Secrets, each with a unique access key, for every virtual cluster. This method provides granular access control and allows revocation of access to individual clusters. This is beneficial in environments with strict security requirements where isolation is critical.

For most scenarios, using a shared access key is the preferred approach due to its simplicity and ease of maintenance.

      <Step title="Create the API Key">
        
        In the platform console, create a [new access key](/platform/next/api/authentication). Assign the `vcluster` role when creating the key.
        
        :::note
        Assigning the `vcluster` role is required. Without it, the vCluster cannot authenticate with the platform and connection errors occur.
        :::

      </Step>
      <Step title="Create the Secret">
        
        Create the `vcluster-platform-api-key` secret in a namespace on the host cluster: 
        
        :::note
        This namespace does **not** need to match the target namespace used by the virtual cluster, but it must exist on the host where the vCluster is deployed.
        :::

       ```bash title="Create Secret"
        kubectl create secret generic vcluster-platform-api-key \
          --from-literal=accessKey=<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY> \
          --from-literal=host=<YOUR_PLATFORM_HOST> \
          -n <SECRET_NAMESPACE>
        ```
        
        - Replace `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>` with your API key.
        - Replace `<YOUR_PLATFORM_HOST>` with your vCluster Platform URL .
        - Replace `<SECRET_NAMESPACE>` with the namespace where you want to store the Secret.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Reference the Secret in vcluster.yaml">
        
        In your `vcluster.yaml` file, reference the Secret by namespace and enable RBAC creation:
        
        ```yaml title="API key configuration"
        external:
          platform:
            apiKey:
              secretName: vcluster-platform-api-key
              namespace: <SECRET_NAMESPACE>
              createRBAC: true
        ```
        - `secretName`: Specifies the name of the Secret containing the API key.
        - `namespace`: Specifies the namespace where the Secret is located. If different from the virtual cluster's namespace, ensure that the virtual cluster has access to this namespace.
        - `createRBAC`: When set to `true`, vCluster automatically creates the necessary `Role` and `RoleBinding` resources to allow access to the Secret.
      </Step>
    </Flow>
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="individual" label="Individual user access">
    <Step title="Configure vcluster.yaml">
      
    Set up your `vcluster.yaml` to use individual user authentication:
      
      ```yaml title="User-based authentication"
      external:
        platform:
          userBased: true
      ```
      
      With this configuration:
      - Each user must generate their own access key in the platform UI.
      - Users provide their personal access key when connecting to the virtual cluster.
      - No shared secret must be created or maintained.
    </Step>
  </TabItem>
