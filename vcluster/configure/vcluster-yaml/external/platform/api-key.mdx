This provides a way to connect directly to the vCluster Platform.

## Example

```
external:
  platform:
    apiKey:
      secretName: # Defaults to vcluster-platform-api-key if undefined
      namespace: # Namespace to search for the secret. If undefined, it searches the namespace that the vCluster is deployed in. If different than the namespace of the vCluster deployment, then vCluster needs access to that namespace. 
      createRBAC: # Default enabled to create the necessary RBAC roles and role bindings in order to find the secret
      
```

## Config reference
