You can assign a vCluster to a specific platform project by adding the project ID to your `vcluster.yaml` configuration file. This assignment happens when you first create the vCluster and connects it to the designated project in the platform interface.

When you create a vCluster without specifying a project, vCluster automatically assigns it to the default project. This ensures every vCluster belongs to a project for proper organization and access control.

## Example

Add the project assignment to your `vcluster.yaml` file:

<br />

<InterpolatedCodeBlock 
  code={`
 external:
  platform:
    apiKey:
      secretName: [[VAR:API KEY SECRET:vcluster-platform-api-key]]
      namespace: [[VAR:NAMESPACE:vcluster-platform]]
    project: [[VAR:PROJECT ID:production]]`}
  language="yaml" 
/>

:::note Project assignment permanence
You cannot change the project assignment after creating the vCluster. This restriction maintains data integrity and prevents accidental resource movement.

## Change projects

If you modify the project ID in `vcluster.yaml` after creating the vCluster, the platform interface does not reflect this change. Instead, the vCluster pod generates a warning message in its logs to alert you about the invalid configuration.

### Change projects example

You create a vCluster assigned to the `development` project:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
external:
  platform:
    apiKey:
      secretName: vcluster-platform-api-key
      namespace: vcluster-platform
    project: development
```

Then, if you later modify the configuration to move the vCluster to the `production` project:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
external:
  platform:
    apiKey:
      secretName: vcluster-platform-api-key
      namespace: vcluster-platform
    project: production
```

The vCluster pod detects this invalid change and logs an error:

```bash
2025-06-19 07:53:38	INFO	online/license.go:174	Trying to register vCluster in the Platform	{"component": "vcluster"}
2025-06-19 07:53:39	ERROR	online/license.go:442		{"component": "vcluster", "error": "vcluster is currently imported in project \"development\", it cannot be moved to \"production\""}
```

This warning confirms that the vCluster remains in its original project despite the configuration change.
