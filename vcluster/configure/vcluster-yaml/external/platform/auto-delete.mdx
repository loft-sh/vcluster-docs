import AutoDelete from '@site/platform/api/_partials/resources/config/external/platform/autoDelete.mdx'

The virtual cluster can be scheduled to sleep in the `vcluster.yaml`, but in order to use this ability, the vCluster also will need to be connected to the platform.   

## Example

```
external:
  platform:
    autoDelete: 
      afterInactivity: 600 # Default is set to seconds, so this equates to 10 minutes
```

## Config reference

<AutoDelete />
