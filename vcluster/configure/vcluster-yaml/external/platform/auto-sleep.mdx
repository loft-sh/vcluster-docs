<ProAdmonition/>

The virtual cluster can be scheduled to sleep and wake up in the `vcluster.yaml`, but in order to use this ability, the vCluster also will need to be connected to the platform.

## Example

```
external:
  platform:
    autoSleep:
      schedule: * 17 * * * # Sleep at 5 PM
      autoWakeup:
        schedule: * 9 * * * # Wakeup at 9 AM
```

## Config reference

<AutoSleep />
