vCluster allows you to sync custom resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. This allows you to sync arbitrary resources that are by default not synced by vCluster. This only works for resources that have a custom resource definition in the host cluster.

If those custom resources create other resources inside the host cluster, vCluster tries to find them and syncs them back to the host cluster as well. E.g. a [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) certificate creates a secret which syncs back automatically into the virtual cluster.

vCluster automatically adds the required cluster and namespace RBAC permissions for retrieving the custom resource definition and syncing the resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster.
<br />

:::info Only Namespace-Scoped Resource
This feature currently only works for namespace-scoped resources only.
:::

:::info Multi-Namespace-Mode
If you want to sync many custom resources, consider using [namespace syncing](../../../sync/to-host/advanced/namespaces).

## Enable custom resource syncing {#enable-custom-resource-syncing}

To enable custom resource syncing from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, figure out what CRDs you want to sync via `kubectl get crds`. Add the name into the `customResources` section in the sync section. Even though vCluster syncs custom resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, the CRDs are also copied from the host cluster to the virtual cluster.

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
```



## Patches

You can modify the sync behavior with patches that target specific paths. Currently there are 2 different kinds of patches supported.

:::info Wildcard patches
You can use `*` in paths to select all entries of an array or object, e.g. `spec.containers[*].name` or `spec.containers[*].volumeMounts[*]`. vCluster calls the patch multiple times.
:::

### Reference patches

A reference patch can be used to have a specific field of one resource point to a different resource that should get rewritten. vCluster automatically imports the referenced resource to the virtual cluster if it can find it in the host cluster. For example:


```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.secretName
          reference:
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Secret
```

vCluster translates the path `spec.secretName` as it points to a secret. If the secret is created in the host cluster, vCluster automatically imports it into the virtual cluster.

:::info Multi-Namespace-Mode
With multi-namespace-mode you only need to rewrite references that include a namespace. You can use the `namespacePath` option to specify the path of the namespace of the reference.

### JavaScript expression patches {#javascript-expression-patches}
<!-- vale on -->

These are JavaScript ES6 compatible expression patches that can be used to change a field while syncing. You define how it changes when syncing from the virtual cluster into the host cluster or when syncing from the host cluster into the virtual cluster. To add a suffix to certificate DNS names you can:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.dnsNames[*]
          # specifies the sync direction here again, because you can also react on change for fromHost with an expression
          expression: '"www."+value'
          # optional reverseExpression, if omitted patches from host will be discarded for that path
          # reverseExpression: 'value.slice("my-prefix".length)'
```

There is also a variable called `context` besides `value` that can be used to access vCluster specific data:
- `context.vcluster.name`: Name of the virtual cluster
- `context.vcluster.namespace`: Namespace of the virtual cluster
- `context.vcluster.config`: Config of the virtual cluster, basically `vcluster.yaml` merged with the defaults
- `context.hostObject`: Host object (can be null if not available)
- `context.virtualObject`: Virtual object (can be null if not available)
- `context.path`: The matched path on the object, useful when using wildcard path selectors (*)

For example, to add `www.` to every DNS name specified in a cert-manager certificate in the path `spec.dnsNames`, you can use the following patch:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.dnsNames[*]
          # specifies the sync direction here again, because you can also react on change for fromHost
          expression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value : `www.${value}`"
          # specifies how to sync back changes to the virtual cluster. If omitted will not sync back changes.
          reverseExpression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value.slice(4) : value"
```

The patch creates a new certificate within the vCluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: name-within-vcluster
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - example.com
```

vCluster syncs the host cluster and applies your patch, creating this modified certificate:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: synced-name
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - www.example.com # the patch added www. to this field
```

If you directly edit the certificate in the host cluster and change the domain:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: synced-name
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - www.other-domain.com # changed from www.example.com
```

vCluster detects the change, applies the reverse patch, and updates the certificate in your virtual cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: name-within-vcluster
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - other-domain.com # the patch removed the www. from www.other-domain.com
```

## Configure Kubernetes Gateway API sync

To use the Kubernetes Gateway API with custom resources, follow these steps:

### Install Gateway CRD in the host

```bash title="Install Gateway CRD"
kubectl --context="${HOST_CTX}" get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io &> /dev/null || \
kubectl --context="${HOST_CTX}" apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.2.1/standard-install.yaml
```

### Create waypoint gateway {#create-waypoint-gateway}

Create a waypoint gateway configuration:

```yaml title="waypoint-gateway.yaml"
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: waypoint
  labels:
    istio.io/waypoint-for: service
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
```

Apply it to your host cluster:

```bash title="Create Waypoint Gateway"
kubectl --context="${HOST_CTX}" create -f waypoint-gateway.yaml --namespace="${VCLUSTER_HOST_NAMESPACE}"
```

Once configured, you can configure your custom resources to sync Gateway API resources between the virtual and host clusters.
