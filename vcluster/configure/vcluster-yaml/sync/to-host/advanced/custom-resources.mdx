vCluster allows you to sync custom resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. This is useful for syncing resources that are not included in the default sync behavior.

This feature only works for resources that have a corresponding CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) installed in the host cluster.

If a synced custom resource creates additional resources in the host cluster, vCluster attempts to detect and sync those resources back to the virtual cluster. For example, a [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) `Certificate` creates a `Secret`, which is automatically synced into the virtual cluster.

vCluster also adds the necessary cluster and namespace-level RBAC permissions to retrieve the CRD and sync the corresponding resources.

This feature currently only works for namespace-scoped resources only.

## Enable custom resource syncing {#enable-custom-resource-syncing}

To enable custom resource syncing from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, first identify which CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) you want to sync by running `kubectl get crds`. Then, add the name of each CRD to the `customResources` section under `sync` in your `vcluster.yaml` configuration file.

Although the custom resources themselves are synced from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, vCluster also copies the corresponding CRDs from the host cluster into the virtual cluster. This ensures the virtual cluster can understand and manage those custom resources correctly.

By default, you do not need to specify an API version when syncing a custom resource. If the CRD defines multiple versions and no version is explicitly set, vCluster uses the storage version. To sync a specific version, such as when the storage version is not suitable, you can define that version directly in the `vcluster.yaml`.

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
```

## Versioned example

To use a specific version of a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), specify the version before the resource type in the `apiVersion` field, using the `/` separator.
Note that the specified version must exist in the host cluster when the vCluster starts, and it will become the storage version in the vCluster. Be aware that CRs will be converted between the two versions.

For example, to use version `v1` of the `certificates.cert-manager.io` CRD, specify:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io/v1:
        enabled: true
```

:::info Unique CRD versions
vCluster supports syncing only one version of a custom resource. If multiple versions are specified, the virtual cluster fails to start.
:::

### Upgrading custom resources with explicit CRD API versions

When the virtual cluster is upgraded, it checks if the CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) version has changed in the Host. If yes, vCluster updates the CRD inside the virtual cluster to include the new version.

The three possible scenarios are:
1. Going from no version specified to specified version. For example, `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io` upgrading to `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1`.
If the CRD's storage version is not `v1`, vCluster updates the CRD to include `v1` as a new version in addition to the current storage version.

2. Going from one specified version to another specified version. For example, `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1` upgrading to `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v2`.
The CRD is updated to include the new version `v2`, and the old version `v1` is kept as well.

3. Going from specified version to no version specified. For example, `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1` upgrading to `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io`.
If the CRD's storage version in the Host is `v1` nothing happens, and the CRD in the virtual cluster remains as `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1`. If the storage version is not `v1`, vCluster updates the CRD to include the storage version as a new version in addition to `v1`.


## Patches

You can modify the sync behavior with patches that target specific paths. Currently, there are two different kinds of patches supported.

:::info Wildcard patches
You can use `*` in paths to select all entries of an array or object, for example `spec.containers[*].name` or `spec.containers[*].volumeMounts[*]`. vCluster calls the patch multiple times.
:::

### Reference patches

You can use a reference patch to make a specific field in one resource point to another resource that vCluster should rewrite. If the referenced resource exists in the host cluster, vCluster automatically imports it into the virtual cluster.

This is useful when working with resources like `Certificate`, which reference a `Secret` created by cert-manager:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.secretName
          reference:
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Secret
```

vCluster translates the path `spec.secretName` as it points to a Secret. If the Secret is created in the host cluster, vCluster automatically imports it into the virtual cluster.

### JavaScript expression patches {#javascript-expression-patches}
<!-- vale on -->

These are JavaScript ES6 compatible expression patches that can be used to change a field while syncing. You define how it changes when syncing from the virtual cluster into the host cluster or when syncing from the host cluster into the virtual cluster. To add a suffix to certificate DNS names you can:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.dnsNames[*]
          # specifies the sync direction here again, because you can also react on change for fromHost with an expression
          expression: '"www."+value'
          # optional reverseExpression, if omitted patches from host are discarded for that path
          # reverseExpression: 'value.slice("my-prefix".length)'
```

There is also a variable called `context` besides `value` that can be used to access vCluster specific data:
- `context.vcluster.name`: Name of the virtual cluster
- `context.vcluster.namespace`: Namespace of the virtual cluster
- `context.vcluster.config`: Config of the virtual cluster, basically `vcluster.yaml` merged with the defaults
- `context.hostObject`: Host object (can be null if not available)
- `context.virtualObject`: Virtual object (can be null if not available)
- `context.path`: The matched path on the object, useful when using wildcard path selectors (*)

For example, to add `www.` to every DNS name specified in a cert-manager certificate in the path `spec.dnsNames`, you can use the following patch:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.dnsNames[*]
          # specifies the sync direction here again, because you can also react on change for fromHost
          expression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value : `www.${value}`"
          # specifies how to sync back changes to the virtual cluster. If omitted does not sync back changes.
          reverseExpression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value.slice(4) : value"
```

The patch creates a new certificate within the vCluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: name-within-vcluster
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - example.com
```

vCluster syncs the host cluster and applies your patch, creating this modified certificate:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: synced-name
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - www.example.com # the patch added www. to this field
```

If you directly edit the certificate in the host cluster and change the domain:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: synced-name
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - www.other-domain.com # changed from www.example.com
```

vCluster detects the change, applies the reverse patch, and updates the certificate in your virtual cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: name-within-vcluster
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - other-domain.com # the patch removed the www. from www.other-domain.com
```

## Configure Kubernetes Gateway API sync

To use the Kubernetes Gateway API with custom resources, install the Gateway API CRDs in the host cluster and then create the waypoint gateway.

### Install Gateway CRD in the host

To create gateway resources, install the Gateway API CustomResourceDefinition in the host cluster if it's not already present:

```bash title="Install Gateway CRD"
kubectl --context="${HOST_CTX}" get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io &> /dev/null || \
kubectl --context="${HOST_CTX}" apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.2.1/standard-install.yaml
```

### Create waypoint gateway {#create-waypoint-gateway}

Create a waypoint gateway configuration:

```yaml title="waypoint-gateway.yaml"
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: waypoint
  labels:
    istio.io/waypoint-for: service
spec:
  gatewayClassName: istio-waypoint
  listeners:
  - name: mesh
    port: 15008
    protocol: HBONE
```

Apply it to your host cluster:

```bash title="Create Waypoint Gateway"
kubectl --context="${HOST_CTX}" create -f waypoint-gateway.yaml --namespace="${VCLUSTER_HOST_NAMESPACE}"
```

After it is configured, you can configure your custom resources to sync Gateway API resources between the virtual and host clusters.
