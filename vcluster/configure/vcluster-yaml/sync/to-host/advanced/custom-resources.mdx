vCluster allows you to sync custom resources from the vCluster to the host cluster. This allows you to sync arbitrary resources that are by default not synced by vCluster. This only works for resources that have a custom resource definition in the host cluster.

If those custom resources will create other resources inside the host cluster, vCluster will try to find them and sync them back to the host cluster as well. E.g. a [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) certificate creates a secret which will be synced back automatically into the vCluster.

vCluster will automatically add the required cluster and namespace RBAC permissions for retrieving the custom resource definition and syncing the resources from the vCluster to the host cluster.

:::info Only Namespace-Scoped Resource
This feature currently only works for namespace-scoped resources only.
:::

:::info Multi-Namespace-Mode
If you want to sync many custom resources, consider using [multi-namespace-mode](../../../experimental/multi-namespace-mode).
:::

## Enable Custom Resource Syncing

To enable custom resource syncing, figure out what CRDs you want to sync via `kubectl get crds`. Copy the name, e.g. `certificates.cert-manager.io` and then configure the `vcluster.yaml` like this:
```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
```

## Translate Patches

You can modify the sync behaviour with translate patches that target specific paths. Currently there is 3 different kinds of patches supported.

:::info Wildcard patches
You can use `*` in paths to select all entries of an array or object, e.g. `spec.containers[*].name` or `spec.containers[*].volumeMounts[*]`. vCluster will then just call the patch multiple times.
:::

### Reference patches

Tell vCluster that this specific field points to a different resource that should get rewritten. vCluster will also automatically import the referenced resource if it can find it in the host cluster. E.g.:
```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.secretName
          reference:
            apiVersion: v1
            kind: Secret
```

This will tell vCluster to translate the path `spec.secretName` as it points to a secret. If the secret is created in the host cluster, vCluster will automatically import it.

:::info Multi-Namespace-Mode
With multi-namespace-mode you only need to rewrite references that include a namespace. You can use the `namespacePath` option to specify the path of the namespace of the reference.
:::

### JavaScript Expressions

These are powerful JavaScript ES6 compatible expressions to change a field while syncing. You can define how it should changed when syncing from the vCluster into the host cluster or when syncing from the host cluster into the virtual cluster. To add a suffix to certificate dns names you can do:
```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.dnsNames[*]
          # specifies the sync direction here again, because you can also react on change for fromHost with an expression
          expression: '"www."+value'
          # optional reverseExpression, if omitted patches from host will be discarded for that path
          # reverseExpression: 'value.slice("my-prefix".length)'
```

There is also a variable called `context` besides `value` that can be used to access vCluster specific data:
* `context.vcluster.name`: Name of the vCluster
* `context.vcluster.namespace`: Namespace of the vCluster
* `context.vcluster.config`: Config of the vCluster, basically `vcluster.yaml` merged with the defaults
* `context.hostObject`: Host object (can be null if not available)
* `context.virtualObject`: Virtual object (can be null if not available)
* `context.path`: The matched path on the object, useful when using wildcard path selectors (*)

For example, let's assume you want to add `www.` to every DNS name specified in a cert-manager certificate in the path `spec.dnsNames`, you could use the following patch:
```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    customResources:
      certificates.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        patches:
        - path: spec.dnsNames[*]
          # specifies the sync direction here again, because you can also react on change for fromHost
          expression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value : `www.${value}`"
          # specifies how to sync back changes to the virtual cluster. If omitted will not sync back changes.
          reverseExpression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value.slice(4) : value"
```

With that patch, creating a new certificate within the vCluster like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: name-within-vcluster
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - example.com
```

Would create the following certificate in the host cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: synced-name
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - www.example.com # the patch added www. to this field
```

When you change now the certificate in the host cluster like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: synced-name
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - www.other-domain.com # changed from www.example.com
```

vCluster would sync back the certificate like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: name-within-vcluster
spec:
  dnsNames:
    - other-domain.com # the patch removed the www. from www.other-domain.com
```
