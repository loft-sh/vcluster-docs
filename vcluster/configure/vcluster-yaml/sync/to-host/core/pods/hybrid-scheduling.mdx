Hybrid scheduling enables virtual clusters to use multiple schedulers simultaneously - both from the host cluster and virtual cluster. Pods within the virtual cluster can use different schedulers based on their individual configuration.

You can enable hybrid scheduling using the following:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    pods:
      hybridScheduling:
        enabled: true
        hostSchedulers:
        - my-custom-scheduler
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
```

You must also enable syncing of real nodes from the host to the virtual cluster. If you don’t, the virtual cluster displays an error.

By default, all nodes from the host cluster are synced to the virtual cluster. To sync only specific nodes, you can define a label selector as shown in the following example:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    pods:
      hybridScheduling:
        enabled: true
        hostSchedulers:
        - my-custom-scheduler
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      labels:
        environment: production
        team: backend
```

## Use host schedulers

`sync.toHost.pods.hybridScheduling.hostSchedulers` specifies a list of schedulers available on the host cluster that virtual cluster pods can use.

The default Kubernetes scheduler on the host cluster is always implicitly included in the `sync.toHost.pods.hybridScheduling.hostSchedulers` list.  

A default scheduler can be used in two ways: by omitting `.spec.schedulerName` or by explicitly setting it to `default-scheduler`. In both cases, the default Kubernetes scheduler running on the host cluster schedules the pod.

### Use custom host schedulers

The following hybrid scheduling configuration allows virtual cluster pods to use the host cluster's custom schedulers my-custom-scheduler and my-gpu-scheduler. 

:::note
This example omits the full vCluster configuration to highlight the relevant hybrid scheduling settings.
:::

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    pods:
      hybridScheduling:
        enabled: true
        hostSchedulers:
        - my-custom-scheduler
        - my-gpu-scheduler
```

You can now deploy pods in the virtual cluster that use the host cluster’s custom schedulers `my-custom-scheduler` and `my-gpu-scheduler`. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-example
spec:
  schedulerName: my-custom-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: pause
    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-gpu-example
spec:
  schedulerName: my-gpu-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: pause
    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10
```

## Use custom virtual schedulers

Virtual cluster pods can use a custom scheduler that runs inside the virtual cluster.  
To ensure these pods are scheduled correctly, **do not** include virtual schedulers in the `sync.toHost.pods.hybridScheduling.hostSchedulers` list in your vCluster configuration.

The following example shows the hybrid scheduling configuration and a pod that uses the `my-virtual-ai-scheduler` running in the virtual cluster.

**Hybrid scheduling configuration**:
```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    pods:
      hybridScheduling:
        enabled: true
```

**Pod**:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-ai-example
spec:
  schedulerName: my-virtual-ai-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: pause
    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10
```

## Other related configurations and cluster permissions

When hybrid scheduling is enabled and PersistentVolumeClaims are synced from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, additional resources must also be present in the virtual cluster for scheduling to function correctly.

By default, vCluster automatically syncs the following resources from the host to the virtual cluster, unless this behavior is explicitly disabled in the configuration:

- `CSINodes`,
- `CSIStorageCapacities`
- `CSIDrivers`


When `PersistentVolumeClaims` are synced to the host cluster, vCluster also enables syncing of `StorageClasses` from the host to the virtual cluster.
However, this only happens if syncing `StorageClasses` from the virtual cluster to the host is disabled in the configuration.

:::warning
Manually disabling `CSINodes`, `CSIStorageCapacities`, `CSIDrivers` and `StorageClasses` sync
in the above cases can cause pod scheduling to fail in your virtual cluster.
:::

vCluster automatically adds the required `ClusterRole` rules to ensure syncing works correctly for automatically enabled `CSINodes`, `CSIStorageCapacities`, `CSIDrivers`, and `StorageClasses`.
