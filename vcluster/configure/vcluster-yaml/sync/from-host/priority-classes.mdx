By default, this is disabled.

PriorityClass resources set which pods get scheduled first when resources are limited. High-priority pods can kick out low-priority pods to get resources.

Typically, each virtual cluster needs its own copy of every PriorityClass. This means creating the same PriorityClass multiple times-once per virtual cluster. If anything changes in your PriorityClass, you must update each copy in each virtual cluster. 
PriorityClass syncing eliminates this duplication and maintenance by making host cluster PriorityClass resources available to virtual clusters. You define priority classes once in the host cluster, and vCluster automatically makes them accessible to virtual clusters.

You can either sync all PriorityClass resources or configure syncing using label selectors. When a virtual cluster pod references a `priorityClassName`, vCluster validates that the corresponding PriorityClass exists in the virtual cluster through the syncing process. If the referenced PriorityClass is not synced (either because it does not exist in the host cluster or does not match your label selector), the pod is not scheduled on the host cluster.
