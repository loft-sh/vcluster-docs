{/*
`priorityClasses.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
*/}

By default, PriorityClass synchronization is disabled.

You can enable this feature to sync `PriorityClass` resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster.

This is useful in scenarios where selective access to Pod configurations is required. Common use cases include:

- **Development environments**: Sync only the PriorityClasses required for development clusters to reduce noise and avoid unnecessary exposure.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Enable teams to use their own PriorityClasses while sharing a single host cluster.
- **Security**: Restrict the PriorityClasses available in the virtual cluster to enforce access control and prevent unintended configurations.

### Enable Syncing priority classes from the host to virtual cluster


```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    priorityClasses:
      enabled: true
```

<!-- vale off -->
### Example

The following configuration syncs all `PriorityClasses` that match the specified labels and expressions from the host cluster to the virtual cluster:

```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    priorityClasses:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          # Match all PriorityClasses with the label `environment` with value `development`
          environment: "development"
        matchExpressions:
          # Match PriorityClasses with the label `kubernetes.io/priority.class` that are either `low` or `medium`
          - key: "kubernetes.io/priority.class"
            operator: In
            values:
              - low
              - medium
```

The `selector` field follows the same syntax as Kubernetes label selectors. Use it to filter which `PriorityClass` resources are synced from the host cluster based on their labels.

:::note
All specified label conditions must match for an `PriorityClass` to be included in the sync.
:::


## Use selectors to filter PriorityClasses

Use `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` to filter which `PriorityClass` resources are synced based on their labels.

- `matchLabels`: Defines exact label key-value pairs.

For example, to sync only `PriorityClasses` labeled `environment: development`:

```yaml
matchLabels:
  environment: development
  ```

- `matchExpressions`: Allows more flexible, set-based filtering.

For example, to sync `PriorityClasses` where the label `kubernetes.io/priority.class` is either `low` or `medium`:

```yaml
matchExpressions:
  - key: kubernetes.io/priority.class
    operator: In
    values:
      - low
      - medium
  ```
Supported operators are `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, and `DoesNotExist`.

For more details on how to use label selectors effectively, refer to the [Kubernetes documentation on label selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#resources-that-support-set-based-requirements).

## Sync behavior and considerations

When `PriorityClass` synchronization is enabled, the vCluster syncer uses selector criteria to control which `PriorityClasses` are synchronized between the host and virtual clusters.

The selector configuration creates a bidirectional filter:

- **From host to virtual cluster**: Only `PriorityClasses` matching the selector criteria are synchronized from the host cluster to the virtual cluster.

- **From virtual cluster to host**: `Pod` resources created in the virtual cluster are synchronized to the host only if they reference `PriorityClasses` that match the selector criteria.

### Resource availability and updates

- Synced `PriorityClass` resources appear in the virtual cluster and can be referenced by `Pod` resources.
- When an `PriorityClass` in the host cluster is modified, the selector is re-evaluated:
- If it still matches, the resource is updated in the virtual cluster.
- If it no longer matches, it is removed from the virtual cluster.
- If an `PriorityClass` fails to meet the selector criteria, a warning is logged in the vCluster syncer podâ€™s output.

### Orphaned Pod resources

- If a synced `PriorityClass` is removed from the virtual cluster (due to selector mismatch or deletion), any `Pod` resources referencing it remain in the virtual cluster.
- These `Pod` resources stop receiving updates but are not automatically deleted.
- To remove them, you must delete them manually in the host cluster.

## Constraint enforcement

The selector acts as both a filter and a validation mechanism:

- **Resource filtering**: Only `PriorityClasses` that match the selector criteria are made available in the virtual cluster's API server.

- **Creation validation**: `Pod` resources in the virtual cluster can only reference `PriorityClasses` that exist in the filtered set.

- **Sync restriction**: `Pod` resources referencing non-matching `PriorityClasses` are blocked from synchronizing to the host cluster.

## Error handling

When a `Pod` resource references a `PriorityClass` that doesn't match the selector criteria:

- The `Pod` synchronization to the host cluster fails.
- An event is recorded on the `Pod` resource in the virtual cluster.
- The event indicates that the specified `PriorityClass` is not available in the host.

The event output looks similar to the following:

```shell
vcluster-virtual-cluster-1:~$ kubectl describe pod my-pod
Name:             my-pod
Namespace:        default
Priority Class:   high
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age   From                Message
  ----     ------            ----  ----                -------
  Warning  SyncWarning       10s   pod-syncer          did not sync pod "my-pod" to host because it does not match the selector under 'sync.fromHost.priorityClasses.selector'
```
