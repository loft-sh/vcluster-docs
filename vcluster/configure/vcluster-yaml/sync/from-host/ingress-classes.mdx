By default, this is disabled.

IngressClass syncing allows virtual clusters to use ingress controllers from the host cluster. Typically, each virtual cluster needs its own ingress controller to handle incoming traffic. With IngressClass syncing enabled, virtual clusters can reference IngressClass resources from the host cluster instead.
You can enable this feature to sync IngressClass resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. Add labels to IngressClass resources in your host cluster and configure vCluster to sync only those that match specific label selectors. When a user creates an Ingress resource in the virtual cluster that references a synced IngressClass, the host cluster's ingress controller handles the traffic routing.
This saves resources since you don't need separate ingress controllers in every virtual cluster. It also gives you centralized control over which ingress capabilities teams can access. 
This approach is useful in scenarios where selective access to ingress configurations is required. Common use cases include:

- **Development environments**: Sync only the IngressClass resources required for development clusters to reduce noise and avoid unnecessary exposure.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Enable teams to use their own IngressClass resources while sharing a single host cluster.
- **Security**: Restrict the IngressClass resources available in the virtual cluster to enforce access control and prevent unintended configurations.

## Enable syncing IngressClasses from the host to virtual cluster

```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    ingressClasses:
      enabled: true
```

<!-- vale off -->

:::note
When `sync.fromHost.ingressClasses.enabled` is set to `true`, vCluster takes control of all IngressClass resources in the virtual cluster. It only allows IngressClass resources that are synced from the host cluster to exist.
If you try to create an IngressClass directly in the virtual cluster, using for example `kubectl create` or `kubectl apply`, vCluster detects it and deletes it immediately. This prevents conflicts between locally-created IngressClasses and those synced from the host cluster, ensuring that only approved IngressClass resources (those made available through the host cluster) exist in the virtual cluster.

## How IngressClass syncing works

When IngressClass sync is enabled, vCluster uses selector criteria to control which IngressClass resources are synced from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. The selector configuration affects two related but separate syncing processes:

- **IngressClass resources**: Sync only from host cluster to virtual cluster based on selector criteria
- **Ingress resources**: Sync from virtual cluster to host cluster, but only if they reference IngressClasses that match the selector criteria

IngressClass resources never sync from the virtual cluster back to the host cluster. The syncing is unidirectional for IngressClasses themselves, but the selector criteria influence which Ingress resources can be successfully synced to the host cluster for processing.

## Using selectors to filter IngressClasses

Selectors provide precise control over which IngressClass resources get synced from the host cluster. vCluster supports two types of selector criteria that follow standard Kubernetes label selector syntax.

The `matchLabels` selector defines exact label key-value pairs that must be present on an IngressClass for it to be synced. This provides straightforward filtering based on specific label values. For example, setting `matchLabels` to `environment: development` syncs only IngressClass resources that have exactly that label and value.

The `matchExpressions` selector allows more flexible, set-based filtering with support for multiple operators:

- `In`: Matches IngressClass resources where the label value exists within a specified list
- `NotIn`: Excludes resources with certain label values  
- `Exists`: Requires the presence of a label key regardless of its value
- `DoesNotExist`: Excludes resources that have a particular label key

All specified label conditions must match for an IngressClass to be included in the sync. This means that if you define both `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`, an IngressClass must satisfy all criteria to be synced to the virtual cluster.

## Sync behavior and considerations

### Resource lifecycle and validation

Synced IngressClass resources function like any other Kubernetes resource in the virtual cluster. Users can view them with `kubectl get ingressclass` and reference them in their Ingress specifications. When you modify an IngressClass in the host cluster, vCluster re-evaluates whether it still matches the selector criteria. If the IngressClass continues to match, vCluster updates the corresponding resource in the virtual cluster to reflect the changes. If the IngressClass no longer matches the selector criteria, vCluster removes it from the virtual cluster.

The selector system acts as both a resource filter and a validation mechanism. As a resource filter, it ensures that vCluster makes only IngressClass resources matching the selector criteria available in the virtual cluster's API server. The selector also functions as a creation validation mechanism - when users create Ingress resources in the virtual cluster, those resources can only reference IngressClass resources that exist in the filtered set.

### Error handling and troubleshooting

When an IngressClass fails to meet the selector criteria during evaluation, vCluster logs a warning in the syncer pod's output to help with troubleshooting and monitoring. This logging provides visibility into which resources are being filtered out and why.

When a user creates an Ingress resource that references an IngressClass not matching the selector criteria, several things occur to provide clear feedback:

- The Ingress synchronization to the host cluster fails
- vCluster records an event on the Ingress resource in the virtual cluster  
- The event indicates that the specified IngressClass is not available according to the current selector configuration

The error output appears as a Kubernetes event that you can view using `kubectl describe`. The event message clearly states that the ingress was not synced because the referenced IngressClass does not match the configured selector criteria. This immediate feedback helps users understand why their Ingress resources are not working and guides them toward using approved IngressClass resources.

### Orphaned resources and cleanup

When vCluster removes a synced IngressClass from the virtual cluster due to selector changes or deletion from the host cluster, any Ingress resources that reference it remain in the virtual cluster. These orphaned Ingress resources stop receiving updates but vCluster does not automatically delete them to prevent unintended data loss. To remove these orphaned resources, you must delete them manually in the host cluster. This manual approach ensures that administrators maintain full control over resource cleanup and can verify that deletions are intentional.

## Examples

### Filter with matchLabels

To sync only IngressClass resources labeled `environment: development`:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
  fromHost:
    ingressClasses:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          environment: development
```

### Flexible filter with matchExpressions

To sync IngressClass resources where the label `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` is either `nginx` or `traefik`:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
  fromHost:
    ingressClasses:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        matchExpressions:
          - key: kubernetes.io/ingress.class
            operator: In
            values:
              - nginx
              - traefik
```

### Combined filter criteria

The following configuration syncs IngressClass resources that match both label and expression criteria:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
  fromHost:
    ingressClasses:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          environment: "development"
        matchExpressions:
          - key: "kubernetes.io/ingress.class"
            operator: In
            values:
              - nginx
              - traefik
```

### Error handling example

When an Ingress resource references an IngressClass that doesn't match the selector criteria, the error output looks like this:

```bash
vcluster-virtual-cluster-1:~$ kubectl describe ingress my-ingress
Name:             my-ingress
Namespace:        default
Ingress Class:    nginx
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age   From                Message
  ----     ------            ----  ----                -------
  Warning  SyncWarning       10s   ingress-syncer      did not sync ingress "my-ingress" to host because it does not match the selector under 'sync.fromHost.ingressClasses.selector'
```
