By default, this is disabled.

IngressClass syncing allows virtual clusters to use ingress controllers from the host cluster. Typically, each virtual cluster needs its own ingress controller to handle incoming traffic. With IngressClass syncing enabled, virtual clusters can reference IngressClass resources from the host cluster instead.

You can enable this feature to sync IngressClass resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. Add labels to IngressClass resources in your host cluster and configure vCluster to sync only those that match specific label selectors. When you create an Ingress resource in the virtual cluster that references a synced IngressClass, the host cluster's ingress controller handles the traffic routing.

This saves resources since you don't need separate ingress controllers in every virtual cluster. It also gives you centralized control over which ingress capabilities teams can access. 

This approach is useful in scenarios where selective access to ingress configurations is required. Common use cases include:

- **Development environments**: Sync only the IngressClass resources required for development clusters to reduce noise and avoid unnecessary exposure.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Enable teams to use their own IngressClass resources while sharing a single host cluster.
- **Security**: Restrict the IngressClass resources available in the virtual cluster to enforce access control and prevent unintended configurations.
