Sync `IngressClass` resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster.

## Enable syncing IngressClasses from the host to virtual cluster

```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    ingressClasses:
      enabled: true
```

### Example

The following configuration syncs all `IngressClasses` that match the specified labels and expressions from the host cluster to the virtual cluster:

```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
  fromHost:
    ingressClasses:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          # Match all IngressClasses with the label `environment` with value `development`
          environment: "development"
        matchExpressions:
          # Match IngressClasses with the label `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` that are either `nginx` or `traefik`
          - key: "kubernetes.io/ingress.class"
            operator: In
            values:
              - nginx
              - traefik
```

The `selector` field follows the same syntax as Kubernetes label selectors. Use it to filter which `IngressClass` resources are synced from the host cluster based on their labels.

:::note
All specified label conditions must match for an `IngressClass` to be included in the sync.
:::

## Use selectors to filter IngressClasses

Use `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` to filter which `IngressClass` resources are synced based on their labels.

- `matchLabels`: Defines exact label key-value pairs.  
  
  For example, to sync only `IngressClasses` labeled `environment: development`:
  
  ```yaml
  matchLabels:
    environment: development
  ```

- `matchExpressions`: Allows more flexible, set-based filtering.

  For example, to sync `IngressClasses` where the label `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` is either `nginx` or `traefik`:
  
  ```yaml
  matchExpressions:
    - key: kubernetes.io/ingress.class
      operator: In
      values:
        - nginx
        - traefik
  ```
  Supported operators are `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, and `DoesNotExist`.

For more details on how to use label selectors effectively, refer to the [Kubernetes documentation on label selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#resources-that-support-set-based-requirements).

### Considerations

When `IngressClass` synchronization is enabled, the vCluster syncer uses selector criteria to control which `IngressClasses` are synchronized between the host and virtual clusters.

The selector configuration creates a bidirectional filter:

- **From host to virtual cluster**: Only `IngressClasses` matching the selector criteria are synchronized from the host cluster to the virtual cluster.

- **From virtual cluster to host**: `Ingress` resources created in the virtual cluster are synchronized to the host only if they reference `IngressClasses` that match the selector criteria.



- `IngressClass` resources synced from the host are available in the virtual cluster. You can create `Ingress` resources in the virtual cluster that reference these synced classes.

- When an `IngressClass` in the host cluster is modified (e.g., patched or updated), the selector is re-evaluated. If it still matches the criteria, the synced `IngressClass` is updated in the virtual cluster. If it no longer matches, it is removed from the virtual cluster.

- If an `IngressClass` cannot be synced because it doesn't meet the selector criteria, a warning is logged in the vCluster syncer pod's stdout.

- Existing `Ingress` resources in the virtual cluster are not automatically deleted if their associated `IngressClass` is removed or no longer matches the selector. However, they will no longer receive updates. To remove them, you must delete them manually in the host cluster.

### Constraint enforcement

The selector acts as both a filter and a validation mechanism:

- **Resource filtering**: Only `IngressClasses` that match the selector criteria are made available in the virtual cluster's API server.

- **Creation validation**: Ingress resources in the virtual cluster can only reference `IngressClasses` that exist in the filtered set.

- **Sync restriction**: Ingress resources referencing non-matching `IngressClasses` are blocked from synchronizing to the host cluster.

### Error handling

When an `Ingress` resource references an `IngressClass` that doesn't match the selector criteria:
- The `Ingress` synchronization to the host cluster fails.
- An event is recorded on the `Ingress` resource in the virtual cluster.
- The event indicates that the specified `IngressClass` is not available in the host.

This should look like this:

```shell
vcluster-virtual-cluster-1:~$ kubectl describe ingress my-ingress
Name:             my-ingress
Namespace:        default
Ingress Class:    nginx
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age   From                Message
  ----     ------            ----  ----                -------
  Warning  SyncWarning       10s   ingress-syncer      did not sync ingress "my-ingress" to host because it does not match the selector under 'sync.fromHost.ingressClasses.selector'
```

### Use cases
- **Development Environments**: Sync specific IngressClasses that are used in development environments.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Allow different teams to use their own IngressClasses while still sharing the same host cluster resources.
- **Security**: Limit the IngressClasses available in the virtual cluster to only those that are necessary.
