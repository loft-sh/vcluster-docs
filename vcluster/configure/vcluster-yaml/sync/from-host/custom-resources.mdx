vCluster allows you to sync custom resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. Resources will only be read by vCluster and then synced in read-only mode into the vCluster. vCluster will copy the CRD itself in the beginning from the host to the virtual cluster and then start syncing the resources into the vCluster. This is especially helpful if you want to show certain resources inside the vCluster, such as ClusterIssuers (for [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/)) or ClusterStores (for [external-secrets](https://external-secrets.io/latest/)).
If you are looking to sync resources from the vCluster to the host cluster, see [syncing custom resources to the host cluster](../to-host/advanced/custom-resources)

:::info Only Cluster-Scoped Resource
This feature currently only works for cluster-scoped resources only.
:::

:::info No need to configure RBAC
vCluster will automatically add the required cluster RBAC permissions for retrieving the custom resource definition and syncing the resources from the host to the virtual cluster.
:::

## Example

To configure vCluster to sync ClusterIssuers from the host cluster (from [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/)):
```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      clusterissuers.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
```
