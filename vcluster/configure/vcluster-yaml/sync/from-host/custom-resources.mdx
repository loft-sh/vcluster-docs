vCluster allows you to sync custom resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. Resources will only be read by vCluster and then synced in read-only mode into the vCluster. vCluster will copy the CRD itself in the beginning from the host to the virtual cluster and then start syncing the resources into the vCluster. This is especially helpful if you want to show certain resources inside the vCluster, such as ClusterIssuers (for [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/)) or ClusterStores (for [external-secrets](https://external-secrets.io/latest/)).
If you are looking to sync resources from the vCluster to the host cluster, see [syncing custom resources to the host cluster](../to-host/advanced/custom-resources)

:::info No need to configure RBAC
vCluster will automatically add the required cluster RBAC permissions for retrieving the custom resource definition and syncing the resources from the host to the virtual cluster.
:::

## Cluster Scope Example

To configure vCluster to sync ClusterIssuers from the host cluster (from [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/)):
```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      clusterissuers.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Cluster
```

## Namespaced Scope CRDs
By default, this is disabled.

Enabling this will allow you to sync namespaced CustomResources from the specified namespaces in the host to the specified namespaces in the vCluster.

It is also possible to modify the name of the synced resource in the virtual cluster.

There is no option to sync from all namespaces in the host.

Sync is one-directional, from host to virtual. If you modify an object in the host, it will be synced to virtual object. When you delete virtual object, it will get re-created if the host object still exist.

Deleting host object will result in deleting virtual object.

### Prerequisites

* All the specified namespaces have to exist in the host at the vCluster startup.
* Custom Resource Definition needs to exist in the host at the vCluster startup.

### Example

:::info No need to configure RBAC
vCluster will automatically add the required cluster RBAC permissions for retrieving the custom resource definition and syncing the resources from the host to the virtual cluster.
:::

For Namespaced Scoped Custom Resources, you need to specify `selector.mappings` in the config. This tells vCluster which host resources should be synced and where (in the virtual cluster).

Namespaces in the virtual cluster will get created automatically during the sync (if they do not exist already).

It is not possible to sync Custom Resources that were already synced from virtual to host, they will be skipped by vCluster.

We will use cert-manager’s CertificateRequest custom resource in our examples.

To sync all CustomResources from a given namespace in the host to the given namespace in the virtual cluster, “namespace/*” wildcard can be used, e.g.:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        selector:
          mappings:
	          # syncs all CertificateRequests from "foo" namespace
	          # to the "bar" namespace in vCluster. CertificateRequests names are unchanged.
            "foo/*": "bar/*"
```

To sync only specific CustomResources from namespaces, you need to provide `namespace/name` as the key and value:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        selector:
          mappings:
            # syncs CertificateRequest named "cm-name" from "foo" host namespace
            # to the "bar" namespace in virtual.
            "foo/cm-name": "bar/cm-name"
```

There is also a handy syntax to sync all CustomResources from vCluster’s own host namespace to the virtual namespace. As vCluster’s namespace is not always known upfront (e.g. when vCluster is created by vCluster Platform), `""` (empty string) is treated as “vCluster’s own host namespace”.

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        selector:
          mappings:
            # syncs all CertificateRequests from vCluster's host namespace
            # to "my-virtual" namespace in vCluster.
            "": "my-virtual"
```

you can also specify only a few CustomResources from vCluster’s own host namespace this way:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        selector:
          mappings:
            # syncs CertificateRequest named "my-cm" from vCluster's host namespace
            # to "my-virtual-namespace" in vCluster.
            "/my-cm": "my-virtual/my-cm"
```

It’s also possible to modify CustomResource name during the sync:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        selector:
          mappings:
            # syncs "foo" CertificateRequest from "cert-manager" namespace in the host
            # as "my-foo" in "my-virtual" namespace in vCluster.
            "cert-manager/foo": "my-virtual/my-foo"
```

### Pro Patches

You can specify `reverseExpression` in the `sync.fromHost.customResources[*].patches` .

They will be applied on the host object and appear in the virtual object.

`expressions` have no effect.

So, for the following `vcluster.yaml` :

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        selector:
          mappings:
            "default/my-cm": "barfoo2/cm-my"
      patches:
        - path: metadata.annotations[*]
          #expression: '"my-prefix-"+value'
          # optional reverseExpression to reverse the change from the host cluster
          reverseExpression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value.slice(4) : value"
```

1. Your CustomResource in the host namespace `default` named `my-cm` will be synced to the namespace `barfoo2` in virtual and named `cm-my`.
2. If `default/my-cm` host object has annotation which value starts with `www.` , e.g.: `my-address: www.loft.sh` then synced object in the virtual cluster `barfoo2/cm-my` will have annotation `my-address: loft.sh` .
