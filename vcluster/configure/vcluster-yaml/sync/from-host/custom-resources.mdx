# Sync custom resources from host to virtual cluster

vCluster allows you to sync custom resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. This feature creates read-only copies of custom resources inside your virtual cluster, making them available to applications and users without giving them direct access to the host cluster.

When you enable custom resource syncing, vCluster first copies the CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) from the host to the virtual cluster, then begins syncing the actual custom resource instances. This is particularly useful for sharing cluster-wide resources like `ClusterIssuers` from [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) or `ClusterStores` from [external-secrets](https://external-secrets.io/latest/) with your virtual cluster workloads.

The synced resources are read-only in the virtual cluster. If you modify them in the host cluster, vCluster automatically updates the virtual cluster copies. However, changes made to these resources within the virtual cluster are not persisted.

If you need to sync resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster instead, see [syncing custom resources to the host cluster](../to-host/advanced/custom-resources).

:::info No need to configure RBAC
vCluster automatically adds the required cluster RBAC permissions for retrieving the CustomResourceDefinition and syncing the resources from the host to the virtual cluster.

## Cluster-scoped example

Cluster-scoped custom resources exist at the cluster level and are not tied to any specific namespace. These are the simplest to sync because they don't require namespace mapping.

To sync `ClusterIssuers` from the host cluster using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/), configure the resource in your `vcluster.yaml` file:

```yaml title="configure cluster-scoped CRD sync from host"
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      clusterissuers.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Cluster
```

By default, vCluster does not require you to specify an API version when syncing custom resources. When a CRD has multiple versions and you don't specify a version, vCluster uses the storage version.

If you want to sync a specific version of a CRD that is not the storage version, you can explicitly specify it in the sync configuration.

<VersionedCrdSyncing yamlTitle="Configure cluster-scoped CR sync from host" scopeName="Cluster"/>

## Namespace-scoped custom resource definitions

By default, namespace-scoped custom resource syncing is disabled.

Enabling this feature allows you to sync namespaced custom resources from specific namespaces in the host cluster to corresponding namespaces in the virtual cluster.

```yaml title="Configure namespace-scoped CRD sync from host"
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        mappings:
          byName:
            # syncs all CertificateRequests from "foo" namespace
            # to the "bar" namespace in a virtual cluster. CertificateRequests names are unchanged.
            "foo/*": "bar/*"
```

Key behaviors for namespace scoped syncing:

- You can modify the name of the synced resource in the virtual cluster.
- You cannot sync from all namespaces in the host cluster.
- Sync is one-directional, from host to virtual. If you modify an object in the host, vCluster syncs the change to the virtual object.
- When you delete a virtual object, vCluster re-creates it if the host object still exists.
- When you delete a host object, vCluster deletes the virtual object.

vCluster creates namespaces in the virtual cluster automatically during the sync if they don't already exist.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

- All specified namespaces must exist in the host cluster when vCluster starts.
- The CustomResourceDefinition must exist in the host cluster when vCluster starts.

### Example

:::info No need to configure RBAC
vCluster automatically adds the required cluster RBAC permissions for retrieving the CustomResourceDefinition and syncing the resources from the host to the virtual cluster.
:::

For namespace scoped custom resources, you must specify `mappings.byName` in the config. This tells vCluster which host resources should be synced and where to place them in the virtual cluster.

vCluster creates namespaces in the virtual cluster automatically during the sync if they don't already exist.

vCluster cannot sync custom resources that were already synced from virtual to host. It skips these resources.

The following is an example with cert-manager's `CertificateRequest` custom resource.

To sync all custom resources from a given namespace in the host to a given namespace in the virtual cluster, use the "namespace/*" wildcard:

```yaml title="Configure custom resource sync from host namespace"
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        mappings:
          byName:
            # syncs all CertificateRequests from "foo" namespace
            # to the "bar" namespace in a virtual cluster. CertificateRequests names are unchanged.
            "foo/*": "bar/*"
```

To sync only specific custom resources from namespaces, provide `namespace/name` as the key and value:

```yaml title="Configure custom resource sync from host for one object"
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        mappings:
          byName:
            # syncs CertificateRequest named "cm-name" from "foo" host namespace
            # to the "bar" namespace in virtual.
            "foo/cm-name": "bar/cm-name"
```

There is also a syntax to sync all custom resources from the virtual cluster's own host namespace to the virtual namespace. Since the virtual cluster's namespace is not always known upfront (for example, when vCluster is created by the platform), `""` (empty string) is treated as "vCluster's own host namespace":

```yaml title="configure custom resource sync from host for virtual cluster's namespace"
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        mappings:
          byName:
            # syncs all CertificateRequests from virtual cluster's host namespace
            # to "my-virtual" namespace in a virtual cluster.
            "": "my-virtual"
```

You can also specify only a few custom resources from the virtual cluster's own host namespace:

```yaml title="configure custom resource sync from host for objects in virtual cluster's namespace"
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        mappings:
          byName:
            # syncs CertificateRequest named "my-cm" from virtual cluster's host namespace
            # to "my-virtual-namespace" in a virtual cluster.
            "/my-cm": "my-virtual/my-cm"
```

It's also possible to modify the custom resource name during the sync:

```yaml title="configure custom resource sync from host and modify name and namespace"
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        mappings:
          byName:
            # syncs "foo" CertificateRequest from "cert-manager" namespace in the host
            # as "my-foo" in "my-virtual" namespace in a virtual cluster.
            "cert-manager/foo": "my-virtual/my-foo"
```

### Patches

You can use patches to transform data as it syncs from the host to the virtual cluster.

When syncing custom resources from host to virtual, you can use `reverseExpression` to modify the data during the sync process. The host cluster remains unchanged, but the virtual cluster gets the modified data.

:::note
`expressions` (used for virtual-to-host syncing) have no effect when syncing from host to virtual.
:::

The following `vcluster.yaml` shows how patches are used:

```yaml title="configure custom resource sync from host with patches"
sync:
  fromHost:
    customResources:
      certificaterequests.cert-manager.io:
        enabled: true
        scope: Namespaced
        mappings:
          byName:
            "default/my-cm": "barfoo2/cm-my"
        patches:
          - path: metadata.annotations[*]
            # optional reverseExpression to reverse the change from the host cluster
            reverseExpression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value.slice(4) : value"
```

In the example:

- The custom resource in the host namespace `default` named `my-cm` is synced to the namespace `barfoo2` in virtual and named `cm-my`.

- If the `default/my-cm` host object has an annotation with a value that starts with `www.` (for example: `my-address: www.loft.sh`), then the synced object in the virtual cluster `barfoo2/cm-my` has the annotation `my-address: loft.sh`.
