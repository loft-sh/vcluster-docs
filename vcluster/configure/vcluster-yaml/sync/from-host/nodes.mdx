This is disabled by default.

vCluster syncs pseudo nodes from the host cluster where there are virtual cluster pods running. Pseudo nodes only have real values for the CPU, architecture, and operating system, while everything else is randomly generated. A single pseudo node can either represent a single real node on the host cluster, or it can represent multiple real nodes. If there are no more pods on a node, vCluster deletes the pseudo node.

However, when you need to access specific node information, you can choose to sync real nodes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. This requires a cluster role.

:::info Node IP obfuscation
By default, vCluster obfuscates node IP addresses—replacing real IPs with placeholder values—when syncing real nodes. This prevents internal network details from being exposed within the virtual cluster. For more information, see [Control node IP visibility](../../../../learn-how-to/control-node-ip-visibility.mdx).

### Sync pseudo nodes 

Sync pseudo nodes to the virtual cluster. This is enabled by default. This default configuration does not require a cluster role.

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: false
```

vCluster ignores the `selector.all` and `selector.labels` fields. However, if a pod is created with `spec.nodeSelector`, the syncer generates a pseudo node in the virtual cluster. This pseudo node includes annotations and labels from the real node, allowing the pod’s node selector to match a corresponding node within the virtual cluster.

For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation on [`spec.nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector).

### Sync real nodes

Sync real nodes to the virtual cluster where virtual cluster pods are running:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
```

### Sync pseudo nodes with label selector

Sync pseudo nodes that match a given label selector. This example sets the node selector to the same values when syncing a pod from virtual cluster to host cluster:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: false
      selector:
        labels:
          environment: production
          team: backend
```

### Sync real nodes with label selector

Sync real nodes that match a given label selector. This example sets the node selector to the same values when syncing a pod from virtual cluster to host cluster:
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        labels:
          environment: production
          team: backend
```

### Sync all real nodes

Sync all real nodes, regardless of whether a virtual cluster pod is running on it or not:
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        all: true
```

### Sync real nodes and sync back labels and taints

Enable syncing real nodes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster as well as syncing back from the virtual cluster any changes to node labels and taints. Enabling this adds RBAC permissions to the syncer component to allow it to modify the host nodes and statuses.
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      syncBackChanges: true
```

### Sync real nodes and hide image information

Enable syncing real nodes. This clears all `status.images` from the node when it is synced to the virtual cluster. For certain multi-tenant use cases, such as multi-customer tenancy, images can leak sensitive information about a node.
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      clearImageStatus: true
```

### Node sync configuration options

`nodes.enabled`:
- Covered in the general [syncer configuration documentation](/vcluster/introduction/architecture#enable-or-disable-synced-resources)
- Required to schedule any pods in the virtual cluster.
- Can be disabled in the control plane vCluster when using [isolated control planes](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/experimental/isolated-control-plane), where all workloads are instead scheduled in the workload vCluster (which should have node syncing enabled).

`nodes.syncBackChanges`:
- Replaces the deprecated `--sync-node-changes` flag.
- Enables syncing of labels and taints from virtual cluster nodes back to host cluster nodes.
- Requires additional RBAC permissions to modify `Node` and `Node/status` resources in the host cluster.

`nodes.clearImageStatus`:
- Controls the `--node-clear-image-status` flag.
- Clears the `status.images` field from node objects to prevent leaking container image metadata.
- Useful in multi-tenant environments to reduce exposure of underlying node-level information.

`nodes.selector.all`:
- Sets the `--sync-all-nodes` syncer flag.
- When enabled, syncs all nodes from the host cluster into the virtual cluster.

`nodes.selector.labels`:
- Selects specific node labels to sync into the virtual cluster.
- Allows control over which host nodes the vCluster sees or can schedule workloads to.
- Example use cases include:
  - Restrict vCluster to nodes in a specific region.
  - Target nodes with a particular architecture.
  - Use only spot or preemptible instances.
  - Prevent vCluster workloads from running on critical infrastructure nodes.
