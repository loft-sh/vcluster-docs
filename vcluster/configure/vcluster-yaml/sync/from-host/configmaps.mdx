:::info No need to configure RBAC
vCluster automatically adds the required cluster RBAC permissions for retrieving the config maps and syncing the resources from the host to the virtual cluster.
:::

Enabling this allows you to sync ConfigMaps from the specified namespaces in the host to the specified namespaces in the vCluster.

It is also possible to modify the name of the synced resource in the virtual cluster.

There is no option to sync from all namespaces in the host.

Sync is one-directional, from host to virtual. If you modify an object in the host, vCluster syncs the change to virtual object. When you delete a virtual object, vCluster re-creates it if the host object still exist.

When you delete a host object, vCluster deletes the corresponding virtual object.

Namespaces in the virtual cluster are created automatically during the sync (if they do not exist already).

It is not possible to sync ConfigMaps that were already synced from virtual to host, they are skipped by vCluster.

:::info kube-root-ca configmap is skipped
ConfigMaps named `kube-root-ca.crt` are skipped in the from host sync (even if they match the mappings specified in `vcluster.yaml`).
:::

You can use synced ConfigMaps in your workloads as an environment variables source or a volume.

## Prerequisites
All the specified namespaces have to exist in the host at the vCluster startup.


## Sync all config maps from host namespace
To sync all ConfigMaps from a given namespace in the host to the given namespace in the virtual cluster, “namespace/*” wildcard can be used, e.g.:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        mappings:
          # syncs all ConfigMaps from "foo" namespace
          # to the "bar" namespace in vCluster. ConfigMaps names are unchanged.
          "foo/*": "bar/*"
```

## Sync only specific config maps from host namespace
To sync only specific ConfigMaps from namespaces, you need to provide `namespace/name` as the key and value:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        mappings:
          # syncs ConfigMap named "cm-name" from "foo" host namespace
          # to the "bar" namespace in virtual.
          "foo/cm-name": "bar/cm-name"
```

## Sync all config maps from vCluster's host namespace
There is also a handy syntax to sync all ConfigMaps from vCluster’s own host namespace to the virtual namespace. As vCluster’s namespace is not always known upfront (e.g. when vCluster is created by the platform), `""` (empty string) is treated as “vCluster’s own host namespace”.

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        mappings:
          # syncs all ConfigMaps from vCluster's host namespace
          # to "my-virtual" namespace in vCluster.
          "": "my-virtual"
```

## Sync specific config map from vCluster's host namespace
you can also specify only a few ConfigMaps from vCluster’s own host namespace this way:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        mappings:
          # syncs ConfigMap named "my-cm" from vCluster's host namespace
          # to "my-virtual-namespace" in vCluster.
          "/my-cm": "my-virtual/my-cm"
```

## Modify synced config map namespace and name in the virtual cluster
It’s also possible to modify ConfigMap name during the sync:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        mappings:
          # syncs "config" ConfigMap from "cert-manager" namespace in the host
          # as "my-config" in "my-virtual" namespace in vCluster.
          "cert-manager/config": "my-virtual/my-config"
```

## Pro patches

<ProAdmonition/>

You can specify `reverseExpression` in the `sync.fromHost.configMaps.patches` .

They are applied on the host object and appear in the virtual object.

`expressions` have no effect.

So, for the following `vcluster.yaml` :

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        mappings:
          "default/my-cm": "barfoo2/cm-my"
      patches:
        - path: metadata.annotations[*]
          #expression: '"my-prefix-"+value'
          # optional reverseExpression to reverse the change from the host cluster
          reverseExpression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value.slice(4) : value"
```

1. Your ConfigMap in the host namespace `default` named `my-cm` is synced to the namespace `barfoo2` in virtual and named `cm-my`.
2. If `default/my-cm` host object has annotation which value starts with `www.` , e.g.: `my-address: www.loft.sh` then synced object in the virtual cluster `barfoo2/cm-my` has annotation `my-address: loft.sh` .
