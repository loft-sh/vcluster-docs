The `vcluster.yaml` configuration file defines how your virtual cluster operates and integrates with the host cluster. Use the `vcluster.yaml` file to configure vCluster. It allows you to override default settings by specifying resource sync rules, networking behavior, storage options, and authentication methods. 

If you're familiar with [Helm](https://helm.sh/), you can use `vcluster.yaml` in the same way as a [`values.yaml`](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/) file. All vCluster deployment methods are based on Helm, which ensures consistent behavior across environments.

The configuration file controls resource synchronization between the host cluster and the virtual cluster, network access methods, storage persistence, authentication settings, and external service integrations. You can apply most configurations during deployment or upgrades, though some settings like the data store must be configured during initial deployment.

To explore configuration options, review the [vCluster chart values file](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/blob/main/chart/values.yaml) for default settings and available parameters. The [vCluster Helm chart](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/blob/main/chart/values.schema.json) also includes a JSON schema for validating `vcluster.yaml`. For more information on configuration structure, see [What is vcluster.yaml?](/vcluster/next/configure/what-is-vcluster-yaml).

## Deploy a virtual cluster

Before you deploy, you should review the [different tenancy models](../tenancy-model) to determine how the infrastructure of the virtual 
cluster will be configured. 

Once you've determined your tenancy model, read the different ways to deploy:

* [Basics](../../deploy/control-plane/container/basics)
* [High Availability](../../deploy/control-plane/container/high-availability)
* [Using Flux](../../deploy/control-plane/container/flux)
* In Different environments
  * [EKS](../../deploy/control-plane/container/environment/eks)
  * [AKS](../../deploy/control-plane/container/environment/aks)
  * [GKE](../../deploy/control-plane/container/environment/gke)
  * [OpenShift](../../deploy/control-plane/container/environment/openshift)
