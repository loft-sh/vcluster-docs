Workloads created by vCluster are able to communicate with other workloads in the host cluster through their cluster IPs. Configure network policies when you want to isolate namespaces and do not want the pods running inside the virtual cluster to have access to other workloads in the host cluster.

## Enable network isolation {#enable-isolation}

Set `policies.networkPolicy.enabled` to create NetworkPolicies that isolate the virtual cluster:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
```

This creates NetworkPolicies in the host namespace that:
- Allow traffic between pods within the virtual cluster
- Block traffic from other namespaces
- Permit DNS and API server communication

### Example configurations {#examples}

#### Basic isolation {#basic-isolation}

The simplest configuration enables network isolation with default settings:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
```

#### Custom ingress and egress rules {#custom-rules}
Control inbound and outbound traffic with specific ports and IP addresses for vCluster control plane and workloads:
```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true

    workload:
      ingress:
        # Allow ingress from anywhere to specific ports
        - ports:
            - port: 6060
            - port: 444

      egress:
        # Allow egress to a specific address and port
        - to:
            - ipBlock:
                cidr: 172.19.10.23/32
          ports:
            - port: 7777
              protocol: TCP

      publicEgress:
        # Disable convenience common public egress rule.
        enabled: false

    controlPlane:
      ingress:
        # Allow ingress traffic from anywhere to the virtual cluster control plane api
        - ports:
            - port: 8443

      egress:
        # Allow egress traffic to a specific address
        - to:
            - ipBlock:
                cidr: 172.19.10.23/32

```

:::note
`ingress` and `egress` config sections accept the same content type as [PodNetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#podnetworkpolicy-resource)
:::

#### Add custom labels {#custom-labels}

Apply labels to generated NetworkPolicies for easier management:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
    labels:
      environment: production
      team: platform
    annotations:
      description: "Network isolation for production vCluster"
```

## Project-scoped isolation with Platform {#project-scoped-isolation}

For Platform users needing project-level network boundaries, combine `policies.networkPolicy` with [VirtualClusterTemplates](/platform/administer/templates/create-templates):

```yaml title="project-isolated-template.yaml"
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: VirtualClusterTemplate
metadata:
  name: project-isolated
spec:
  template:
    helmRelease:
      chart:
        version: 0.26.0
      values: |
        policies:
          networkPolicy:
            enabled: true
            labels:
              vcluster.io/project: "{{ .Values.loft.project }}"
```

This automatically:
- Isolates virtual clusters by project
- Allows communication within the same project
- Enforces network boundaries for CI/CD pipelines
