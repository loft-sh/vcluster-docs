import NetworkPolicy from '@site/vcluster/_partials/config/policies/networkPolicy.mdx'


Workloads created by vCluster are able to communicate with other workloads in the host cluster through their cluster IPs. Configure network policies when you want to isolate namespaces and do not want the pods running inside the virtual cluster to have access to other workloads in the host cluster.
