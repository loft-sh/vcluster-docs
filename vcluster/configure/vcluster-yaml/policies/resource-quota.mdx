You can control vCluster resource consumption by configuring a ResourceQuota. vCluster creates the ResourceQuota in the same namespace as vCluster itself. Resource quotas apply to all resources synced to the host cluster.

## Example

If you would normally deploy the following ResourceQuota:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
    name: pods-medium
  spec:
    hard:
      cpu: "10"
      memory: 20Gi
      pods: "10"
    scopeSelector:
      matchExpressions:
      - operator : In
        scopeName: PriorityClass
        values: ["medium"]
```

Instead configure the ResourceQuota in your `vcluster.yaml` config file like this:

```yaml
policies:
  resourceQuota:
    enabled: true
    quota:
      cpu: "10"
      memory: 20Gi
      pods: "10"
    scopeSelector:
      matchExpressions:
        - operator : In
          scopeName: PriorityClass
          values: ["medium"]
```
