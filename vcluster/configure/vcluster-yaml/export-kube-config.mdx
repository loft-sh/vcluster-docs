import ExportKubeConfig from '../../_partials/config/exportKubeConfig.mdx'

Customize how vCluster exports the kubeconfig file to a secret, so you can use it, for example, in your ArgoCD or Terraform pipelines.

vCluster always creates a kubeconfig in a secret called `vc-NAME` in the namespace where you deployed vCluster. Configure `exportKubeConfig` so vCluster creates an additional secret with the given configuration.

{/*
`--kube-config-context-name` is now the `context` property:
  - https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/554 is the issue where this was requested
  - Configures the context name in the kubeconfig that is written to a secret.
`--out-kube-config-server` is now the `server` property:
  - https://www.vcluster.com/docs/using-vclusters/kube-context#externally-accessible-vclusters
`--out-kube-config-secret-namespace` is now the `secret.namespace` property.
  - It appears in the "Tip" at the bottom of this section: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/using-vclusters/kube-context#retrieving-the-kube-config-from-the-vcluster-secret
`--out-kube-config-secret` is now the `secret.name` property:
  - It did not have a section in the old docs, but has been part of vcluster from the initial commit, and has always been set to `vc-{{ .Release.Name }}` by the helm chart.
  - We may not want people changing this.

| Deprecated Parameter             | Config Field       | Notes |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| `--kube-config-context-name`         | `context`          | You can configure the context name in the kubeconfig.   |
| `--out-kube-config-server`           | `server`           | If you have exposed the virtual cluster, you can instruct vCluster to create the kubeconfig secret with another server endpoint.   |
| `--out-kube-config-secret-namespace` | `secret.namespace` | You can specify a different namespace where vCluster should create the kubeconfig secret. You have to manually apply RBAC permissions for vCluster to allow creation and retrieving of secrets in that namespace.   |
| `--out-kube-config-secret`           | `secret.name`      | You can configure the secret's name, which otherwise uses the `vc-<cluster-name>` pattern.   |

## Example using the same namespace for the secret

In this example:

- You want to call this kubeconfig context `my-domain-context`.
- You have exposed the virtual cluster on `https://my-domain.org` and want the kubeconfig to use that endpoint.
- You named your cluster "my-cluster" but you want the secret's name to reflect the virtual cluster domain name.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-domain-context
  server: https://my-domain.org:443
  secret:
    name: vc-my-domain
```

## Example using a new namespace for the secret

In this example:

- You want to call this kubeconfig context `my-domain-context`.
- You have exposed the virtual cluster on `https://my-domain.org` and want the kubeconfig to use that endpoint.
- You created a namespace called `kubeconfig-secret-namespace` for the secret.
- You named your cluster "my-cluster" but you want the secret's name to reflect the virtual cluster domain name.
- You have acccess to the new namespace by creating a role and rolebinding pointing to the vCluster service account. Make sure that the new role has the same permissions as the vCluster app's role in the vCluster app's namespace. You can copy them directly from the ones created by vCluster when you deployed vCluster. vCluster permissions are dynamic, so updating some configurations may require you to update the unmanaged role in the target namespace.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-domain-context
  server: https://my-domain.org:443
  secret:
    namespace: kubeconfig-secret-namespace
    name: vc-my-domain
```
