[Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s)](https://k3s.io) is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances. For more information on features, see the [K3s docs](https://docs.k3s.io/).

To use K3s with default deployment options, add the following to your `vcluster.yaml` config file:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  distro:
    k3s:
      enabled: true
```

:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, changing the Kubernetes distribution of vCluster is not supported.
