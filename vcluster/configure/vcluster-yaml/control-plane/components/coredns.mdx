## Separate CoreDNS

Each vCluster has its own DNS service (CoreDNS by default) so that pods and services can locate each other by hostnames. The vCluster syncer ensures that the intuitive naming logic of Kubernetes DNS names for services applies. Users can connect to these DNS names, which map to the IP address of the synchronized services that are present in the host cluster. However, this also means that you can't directly access host services from inside the virtual cluster via DNS. Host cluster pods can only access virtual cluster services by their synced name. 

Customize the CoreDNS deployment if you need to pull the CoreDNS image from a private registry. 

See [DNS for Services and Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/) for details on Kubernetes DNS.

A normal vCluster deployment consists of two pods per vCluster instance:

- vCluster Pod
  - API server container
  - Syncer container
- CoreDNS Pod

:::note CoreDNS listens on port 1053
vCluster's CoreDNS service listens on port `1053` instead of the default DNS port `53` to avoid conflicts with DNS on the host cluster.

If you're running vCluster on EKS or another cloud provider with strict network policies, you must allow traffic on port `1053` between nodes to avoid DNS resolution issues.

For more deails, see the [Networking documentation](/platform/administer/clusters/advanced/networking).

## Integrated CoreDNS

(Pro) The integrated CoreDNS feature lets you run CoreDNS as part of the syncer, which saves the overhead of an external CoreDNS pod. 

- vCluster Pod
  - API server container
  - Syncer and CoreDNS container

Key benefits to this approach include:

- Avoiding cluster max pods limit
- Optimizing resource allocation
