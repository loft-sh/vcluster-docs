# Database

When using a database as the backing store, you can choose between two deployment options:

- [Embedded](/vcluster/next/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/database/sqlite): The database is deployed inside the virtual cluster control plane.

- [External](/vcluster/next/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/database/external): The database runs outside the virtual cluster control plane. You can either:
  - Connect to an existing database.
  - Connect to a database server. (This option requires vCluster Platform.)
