## Introduction

This guide explains how to configure an external database as the backing store for a virtual cluster. A backing store is a persistent storage solution that maintains the state and data of the virtual cluster. Using an external database can provide better performance, scalability, and data persistence compared to the default embedded storage.

Configure this feature to use an external database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for your virtual cluster's backing store.

```yaml title="External database configuration"
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      external:
        enabled: true
        dataSource: CONNECTION_STRING
        connector: CONNECTOR_STRING
```

## Connector and data source

There are two mutually exclusive options for using an external backing store.

`dataSource`: assign a connection string to `dataSource` that the virtual cluster uses for its control plane backing store.

`connector`: assign a name of a [connector secret](/docs/platform/administer/connector/database) that exists in an instance of the platform in the installed namespace. The platform uses the secret to automatically provision a separate database within the database server for the virtual cluster. It also creates a non-privileged user that can only interact with the virtual cluster's database. The virtual cluster receives a connection string built from the user and database.

|                               | Connector | DataSource |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| MySQL Support                 | Yes       | Yes        |
| PostgreSQL Support            | Not yet   | Yes        |
| Share Across virtual clusters | Yes       | No         |
| Automatic DB Cleanup          | Yes       | No         |
| Credential stored in secret   | Yes       | No         |

### Datasource configuration

Replace `CONNECTION_STRING` with the connection string for your database. Examples:

- PostgreSQL: `postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/vcluster-db`
- MySQL: `mysql://root:password@tcp(192.168.86.9:30360)/vcluster`

:::warning
Changing the backing store of a virtual cluster after deployment is not supported.
:::

### Connector configuration

An administrator must first set up a [database connector secret](/docs/platform/administer/connector/database) in the platform. Your virtual cluster must have access to the platform.

Once the connector secret has been configured, assign the name of the secret to the `connector` field.

:::note
Any virtual cluster can connect to the platform. This is usually done by configuring a platform [API key](../../../../../../configure/vcluster-yaml/external/platform/api-key). Connecting to the platform allows for centralized management and monitoring of virtual clusters, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
