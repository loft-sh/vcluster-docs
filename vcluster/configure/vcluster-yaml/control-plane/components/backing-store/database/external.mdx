Configure this feature if you want to use an external database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

```yaml title="external database configuration"
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      external:
        enabled: true
        dataSource: CONNECTION_STRING
        connector: CONNECTOR_STRING
```

## Connector and data source

There are two mutually exclusive options for using an external backing store.

_dataSource_: assign a connection string to `dataSource` that the vCluster uses for its control plane backing store.

_connector_: assign a name of a [connector
secret](/docs/platform/administer/connector/database) that exists in an instance
of the platform in the installed namespace. The platform uses the secret to automatically
provision a separate database within the database server for the vCluster. It also created a non-privileged user that can only interact with the vCluster's database. The vCluster
receives a connection string built from the user and database.

|                               | Connector | DataSource |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| MySQL Support                 | Yes       | Yes        |
| PostresSQL Support            | Not yet   | Yes        |
| Share Across virtual clusters | Yes       | No         |
| Automatic DB Cleanup          | Yes       | No         |
| Credential stored in secret   | Yes       | No         |

### Datasource configuration

Replace _`CONNECTION_STRING`_ with the connection string for your database. Examples:

- PostgreSQL: `postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/vcluster-db`.
- MySQL: `mysql://root:password@tcp(192.168.86.9:30360)/vcluster`.

:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, changing the backing store of vCluster is not supported.
:::

### Connector configuration

Adminstrator must first setup a [database connector
secret](/docs/platform/administer/connector/database) in the platform. Your
vCluster must have access to the platform.

Once the connector secret has been configured, you cann assign the name of the secret to the `connector` field.
:::note
Any vCluster can connect to the platform. This is usually done by configuring a
the platform [API key](../../../../../../configure/vcluster-yaml/external/platform/api-key).
