import BackingStore from '../../../../../_partials/config/controlPlane/backingStore.mdx'


Each virtual cluster requires a backing store. By default, vCluster uses an embedded SQLite database as the backing store. This option is great for smaller sandbox virtual clusters, but for production, it's recommended to use a different backing store option.

vCluster provides two different types of backing store options:

* etcd - link to https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/next/category/etcd
* database - link to https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/next/category/database

:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, changing the backing store of vCluster is not supported.
