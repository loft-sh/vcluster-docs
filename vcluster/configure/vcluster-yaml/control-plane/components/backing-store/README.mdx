import BackingStore from '@site/vcluster/_partials/config/controlPlane/backingStore.mdx'


Each distro requires a backing store, which can be a database or [etcd](https://etcd.io/). By default, the embedded database is SQLite which is great for smaller virtual clusters, but for production, we recommend either using etcd or an external database.

vCluster is deployed using a StatefulSet (set of pod replicas + persistent volume (disk)) instead of a deployment (set of pod replicas).
