<ProAdmonition/>

When using this backing store option, etcd is deployed as part of the vCluster control plane pod to reduce the overall footprint.

::: warning
If you choose this backing store option, there are no supported migration paths. A new vCluster needs to be deployed to change the backing store. 
:::

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      embedded:
        enabled: true
```
