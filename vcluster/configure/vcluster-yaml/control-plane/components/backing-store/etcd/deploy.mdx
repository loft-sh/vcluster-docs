When using this backing store option, [etcd](https://etcd.io/) is deployed on the host cluster in the same namespace as the <GlossaryTerm term="vcluster">vCluster</GlossaryTerm> control plane pod. vCluster deploys etcd with a StatefulSet, Service, and headless Service.

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
```

## Customize the resources

You can customize the resources that is deployed for etcd. Here are some basic examples, but more options exist in the configuration.

### Set resource requests for the StatefulSet

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
        statefulSet:
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 20m
              memory: 150Mi
```

### Add annotations to each etcd component

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
        statefulSet:
          annotations:
            app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "etcd"
            cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "false"
        service:
          annotations:
            app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "etcd"
        headlessService:
          annotations:
            app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "etcd"
```

### Set the security context of the StatefulSet

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
        statefulSet:
          security:
            podSecurityContext:
              allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

## Migration options

### Migrate to embedded etcd

<ProAdmonition />

You can migrate from deployed <GlossaryTerm term="etcd">etcd</GlossaryTerm> to [embedded etcd](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/embedded) without data loss. This migration simplifies your deployment and reduces resource consumption.

:::tip Migration guide available
For step-by-step instructions on migrating from deployed to embedded etcd while preserving all your data, see the **[complete migration guide](../../../../../../manage/migrate-etcd-backing-store)**.
:::

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      embedded:
        enabled: true
        migrateFromDeployedEtcd: true
```

Deploying with `migrateFromDeployedEtcd: true` retains the external etcd StatefulSet to perform the migration.  After a successful migration, you should see the `Successfully migrated etcd database to embedded etcd` log message in vCluster.
To remove the external etcd after migration, delete `migrateFromDeployedEtcd: true` from the `vcluster.yaml`:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml after etcd migration"
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      embedded:
        enabled: true
```
