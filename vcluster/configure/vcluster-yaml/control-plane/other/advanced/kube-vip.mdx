# Kube-vip

Kube-vip announces the virtual cluster's control plane endpoint IP address on a specified network interface using ARP (layer 2).
This makes the endpoint available to private nodes on the same layer 2 network, allowing them to connect to the control plane using a stable IP address.

Kube-vip is intended to be used with high-availability (HA) deployments.
When the control plane has multiple replicas and a pod is rescheduled to a different host node, kube-vip automatically announces the VIP from the new location using gratuitous ARP, ensuring continuity without manual intervention.

## How it works

When kube-vip is enabled:

1. A virtual IP address (VIP) is configured for the vCluster control plane through the `controlPlane.endpoint` field
2. Kube-vip uses leader election within the virtual cluster to determine which control plane replica manages the VIP
3. The leader announces the VIP on the specified network interface using ARP
4. Worker nodes on the same layer 2 network discover the active control plane instance through ARP
5. If the control plane pod is rescheduled, the new leader sends gratuitous ARP packets to update peers about the new VIP location

## Enable kube-vip

Configure kube-vip in your `vcluster.yaml`:

```yaml
# kube-vip is only compatible with vCluster in privateNodes mode
privateNodes:
  enabled: true

controlPlane:
  # the endpoint must be specified with the VIP
  endpoint: 10.100.0.100:8443
  advanced:
    kubeVip:
      # enable kube-vip
      enabled: true
      interface: eth0
      gateway: 10.100.0.1/24
```

### Configuration options

- **`interface`** - The network interface on which the VIP is announced (e.g., `eth0`, `ens192`). When using in conjunction with Multus, this is normally `net1`.
- **`gateway`** - The gateway address in CIDR notation (e.g., `10.100.0.1/24`). This is used to configure policy-based routing for the VIP and must include the subnet prefix

## Example

Here's a complete example of a vCluster configuration with kube-vip using [Multus](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni).

This example assumes:
- Multus is installed in the host cluster
- A bridge named `br-private` exists on the host nodes
- The bridge is connected to an isolated network where the private nodes are also being deployed

First, create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition for the bridge network:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: private-vcluster
  namespace: vcluster-platform
spec:
  config: |
    {
      "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
      "type": "bridge",
      "bridge": "br-private"
    }
```

Then configure your vCluster:

```yaml
privateNodes:
  enabled: true

controlPlane:
  endpoint: 10.100.0.100:8443
  statefulSet:
    annotations:
      k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: vcluster-platform/private-vcluster
  advanced:
    kubeVip:
      enabled: true
      interface: net1
      gateway: 10.100.0.1/24

networking:
  podCIDR: 10.64.0.0/16
  serviceCIDR: 10.128.0.0/16
```

## Limitations

- The network interface specified must exist on the vCluster control plane instances (e.g. through Multus)
- Worker nodes must be on the same layer 2 network as the specified interface, or the specified gateway must at least be routable from the worker nodes (layer 3)
- Kube-vip only works with ARP mode. Other kube-vip features such as BGP are not supported or configurable

## Security considerations

When kube-vip is enabled, the control plane pods are automatically granted `NET_ADMIN` (to manage the IP on the interface) and `NET_RAW` capabilities (to send gratuitous ARP packets).
These capabilities are required for kube-vip to function and do not need to be configured manually.
