<NetworkPolicyInfo/>

Policies cover several different topics:

- [Limit ranges](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/) control the storage / CPU / memory that each pod may request.
- [Resource quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/).
- [Pod security standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)
- [Network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) like network isolation.
- [Admission webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#admission-webhooks)
  - [Central Admission Control](./admission-control.mdx)
  - The admission controller is typically running on the host cluster, where the policies enforced by the webhook cannot be changed by the virtual cluster.
  - Users could deploy their own admission webhooks to the virtual cluster, but there's little value in doing so, and this configuration is not concerned with that use case.
  - Some examples of admission controller projects:
    - [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/)
    - [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/)
    - [jsPolicy](https://www.jspolicy.com/)
  - It's common for organizations to develop an in-house collection of policies that can enforce naming standards etc.

You can use these settings separately for specific cases, or together, as in the case of Isolated Mode.
