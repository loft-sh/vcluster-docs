Every virtual cluster requires configuration settings that define how the vCluster operates. 
The `vcluster.yaml` file is the central configuration source for these settings. It controls everything from the control plane architecture and
 worker node pool and based on those choices, other features may be limtied. 

When you deploy a virtual cluster, the vCluster CLI uses this configuration file and applies your specified settings. 
The file is optional - if you don't provide one, vCluster applies defaults that work for most use cases using the shared nodes tenancy model, which assumes
using the all the host cluster's workers. However, most production deployments benefit from custom configuration to match specific requirements.

## Configuration structure for vcluster.yaml 

The `vcluster.yaml` file organizes configuration into logical sections. Each section controls a specific aspect of virtual cluster behavior. 

### Control plane settings

The control plane section defines how vCluster runs its Kubernetes API server, controller manager, and data storage. Key configuration areas include:

- **Backing store selection**: Choose between different storage backends for the vCluster control plane's [backing store](./vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/). Options include embedded databases, managed etcd or external databases.
- **Deployment settings**: Configure how the control plane pods deploy, including resource limits, node selectors, and affinity rules.
- **Networking options**: Define how external traffic reaches the virtual cluster's API server, including ingress configuration and service exposure methods.

### Worker node pool settings

You can configure which type of worker nodes to use for the virtual cluster. 

- **Host Cluster's Worker Nodes**: Choose either all or specific nodes of the host cluster's worker nodes. 
- **Individual Nodes**: Choose to use individual nodes that are not connected to any other Kubernetes cluster. 

### Access configuration

You can configure access settings to control how users and applications connect to the virtual cluster:

- **The kubeconfig file**: Configure how vCluster generates and stores [the kubeconfig file](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/export-kube-config) that clients use to connect. This file contains API server endpoints, authentication credentials, and cluster context. You specify the Kubernetes secret name for storage, the context name for identification, and the server URL for connection.
- **Authentication methods**: vCluster supports certificate-based and service account token authentication for secure access to the virtual cluster. When exposing vCluster through an ingress or load balancer, you can use service account tokens if client certificate validation is not supported. Authentication methods can be customized to fit your access requirements.

### Resource sync rules

When using the host cluster's worker nodes, virtual clusters need to share certain resources with their host cluster to function properly. The sync configuration controls this sharing in both directions:

- **From host to virtual**: Configure which host cluster resources appear inside the virtual cluster through [host-to-virtual synchronization](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/). Common examples include nodes, storage classes, and priority classes.
- **From virtual to host**: Define which virtual cluster resources sync to the host cluster through [virtual-to-host synchronization](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/). This typically includes pods, services, and persistent volume claims that need to run on the host.

## Example vcluster.yaml configuration

The following example demonstrates a common configuration and explains each section's purpose:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
# Control plane configuration
controlPlane:
  # Configure the backing store for vCluster's data
  backingStore: # Enterprise feature - requires license
    etcd:
      embedded: 
        enabled: true  # Run etcd inside the vCluster pod
  
  # Expose the API server via ingress
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    host: vcluster-k8s-api.example.com  # Your API server hostname

# Resource synchronization settings when using host cluster's worker nodes
sync:
  # Resources that sync from virtual cluster to host
  toHost:
    serviceAccounts:
      enabled: true  # Sync ServiceAccounts for operators/controllers
  
  # Resources that sync from host to virtual cluster  
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true  # Sync real nodes instead of fake nodes
      clearImageStatus: true  # Remove image data to save resources

# Kubeconfig export configuration
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-vcluster-context  # Name in the kubeconfig file
  server: https://vcluster-k8s-api.example.com  # API server URL
  secret:
    name: my-vcluster-kubeconfig  # Secret name for storing kubeconfig
```

Each configuration section has a specific purpose in the virtual cluster setup:

- **Control plane with embedded storage**: The configuration uses [embedded etcd](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/embedded) as the data store for the virtual cluster's control plane. This approach reduces operational complexity because etcd runs inside the vCluster pod rather than requiring a separate database.
- **API server exposure**: An [Ingress](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/deployment/ingress) resource exposes the virtual cluster's API server through a hostname. This allows external tools and users to access the virtual cluster without port-forwarding or `NodePort` services.
- **ServiceAccount synchronization**: The configuration enables [`ServiceAccount`](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/advanced/service-accounts) syncing from the virtual cluster to the host. This synchronization supports workloads that need specific permissions on the host cluster, such as operators or controllers that manage host resources.
- **Real node synchronization**: Instead of using vCluster's default "pseudo" nodes, this configuration syncs real [node](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes) information from the host cluster. The `clearImageStatus` option removes image information from synced nodes to reduce data transfer and storage requirements.
- **Kubeconfig access**: The configuration defines how vCluster exports the [kubeconfig](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/export-kube-config) for accessing the virtual cluster. The exported kubeconfig gets stored in a Kubernetes secret, making it available for CI/CD pipelines, ArgoCD apps, or Terraform configurations.


## Use vcluster.yaml

The configuration file is used with various vCluster operations throughout the virtual cluster lifecycle.

### Create a new virtual cluster

When you create a virtual cluster, vCluster uses the settings specified in your configuration file. To create a virtual cluster with custom configuration:

<Flow>
<Step>
Save your configuration options in a file named `vcluster.yaml`.
</Step>

<Step>
Run the deployment command with your configuration file:

```bash
vcluster create my-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml
```
</Step>

<Step>
vCluster validates the configuration and creates the virtual cluster with your specified settings.
</Step>
</Flow>

For detailed deployment instructions, see the [deployment documentation](../deploy/control-plane-container/basics.mdx).

### Update an existing virtual cluster

Configuration changes often become necessary as requirements evolve. You can update existing virtual clusters with new configurations. To update an existing virtual cluster:

<Flow>
<Step>
Edit your `vcluster.yaml` file with changes. For example, enable a new sync feature or adjust resource limits.
</Step>

<Step>
Apply the updated configuration to your existing virtual cluster:

```bash
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f vcluster.yaml
```
</Step>

<Step>
vCluster reconciles the differences and updates the deployment. It compares the new configuration with the existing deployment and applies only the changes. The update preserves your workloads and data while updating the virtual cluster components.
</Step>
</Flow>

For configuration change examples and update strategies, see the [deploy changes documentation](../manage/deploy-changes/).

## Frequently asked questions



<details>
<summary><strong>Is a <code>vcluster.yaml</code> file required?</strong></summary>

The `vcluster.yaml` file is optional. If not provided, vCluster applies default settings that:

- Use an embedded database (SQLite).
- Sync essential resources such as pods and services.  
- Configure networking with basic `ClusterIP` services.  
- Enable default authentication and access controls.  

:::note
The `vcluster.yaml` configuration defaults are for development and simple test scenarios. For production use, defining a `vcluster.yaml` file is strongly recommended to meet specific security, performance, and integration needs.

<details>
<summary><strong>Can an existing virtual cluster be updated using <code>vcluster.yaml</code>?</strong></summary>

Yes. You can update an existing virtual cluster by applying a modified `vcluster.yaml` file. This allows you to change the configuration without deleting or recreating the cluster.

To apply changes, use the `--upgrade` flag with the `vcluster create` command:

```bash
vcluster create VCLUSTER_NAME --upgrade -f vcluster.yaml
````

The command performs the following actions:

1. Reads the updated `vcluster.yaml` file.
2. Compares it to the current configuration of the virtual cluster.
3. Applies only the differences between the new and existing configuration.
4. Triggers a rolling update if required to apply the changes.

Some configuration changes, such as updates to sync settings, take effect immediately. Others, such as control plane modifications, may require pod restarts. The vCluster CLI handles these updates automatically and ensures minimal disruption to workloads.

For more details on updating virtual clusters, see the [deployment changes documentation](../manage/deploy-changes/).

<summary><strong>How to migrate from vCluster 0.19.x?</strong></summary>

vCluster v0.20 introduced a new unified configuration format in `vcluster.yaml`. It replaces the older setup, which relied on:

- CLI flags passed during creation  
- Helm values across multiple `values.yaml` files  
- Resource annotations  
- Distribution-specific formats  

:::warning
Pre-v0.20 `values.yaml` files are not compatible with v0.20. Convert to `vcluster.yaml` before using the new CLI or upgrading clusters.
:::

You must migrate to the new `vcluster.yaml` format before upgrading to vCluster v0.20 or later. Older configuration methods—like Helm `values.yaml` files and CLI flags—no longer work with the new version.

Use the [migration guide](/vcluster/reference/migrations/0-20-migration) to walk through:

- Mapping your old CLI flags and Helm values to the new format.
- Adjusting any distribution-specific settings.
- Validating the new configuration to ensure it’s correct.
