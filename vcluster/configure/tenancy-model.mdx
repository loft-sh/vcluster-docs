vCluster supports multiple tenancy models and choosing which model starts with configuring your `vcluster.yaml`. 


## Worker Nodes

You decide what infrastructure is used for the vCluster's worker node pool. Deciding which type of nodes you want to use for your vCluster
must be determined upon vCluster creation. There is no migration/upgrade between the different worker node pool types.

### Use nodes from the shared host cluster

The following tenancy models use the worker nodes in the shared host cluster that the vCluster is deployed on. 

* **Shared Nodes** - (Default) All worker nodes of the shared host cluster are used by the virtual cluster and all resources are synced to the single namespace that the vCluster is deployed on. 
* **[Dedicated Nodes](./vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes)** - Select nodes using labels from the host cluster which are used as worker nodes for the virtual cluster.

#### Resource Syncing

After selecting which set of worker nodes to use from the shared host cluster, you'll need to decide how you want resources are synced to the host cluster. 

* **Single Namespace** - (Default) - All resources are synced to a single namespace, specifically the namespace that the virtual cluster control plane pod is in. Names of the resources are translated to new names on the host cluster to eliminate any naming conflicts.
* **[Namespace Syncing](./vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/advanced/namespaces)** - Enable syncing namespaces between the virtual cluster and host cluster. This allows the selected namespaces and its resources to be synced directly from the virtual cluster to the host cluster without any name translations. 


### Join individual nodes to the vCluster

THe following tenancy models use individual nodes that are joined individually to the vCluster. 

One key benefit of using private nodes is that vCluster can automatically manage the lifecycle of the worker nodes.

* **[Private Nodes](./vcluster-yaml/private-nodes)** - Enable only adding individual nodes to the virtual cluster. 

## Shared Host Nodes vs. Individual Nodes 

The following table outlines the differences between using private nodes and shared nodes:

| Feature                                    | Shared Host Nodes           | Individual Private Nodes                 |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Isolated control plane                     | Yes                          | Yes                          |
| Ability to install custom CNI              | No                          | Yes                           |
| Ability to install custom CSI drivers      | No                          | Yes                           |
| Isolated network                           | No                          | Yes                           |
| Ability to re-use host controllers         | Yes                           | No                          |
| Ability to view vCluster resources in the host cluster | Yes              | No                          |
