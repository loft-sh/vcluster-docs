vCluster supports multiple tenancy models and choosing which model starts with configuring your `vcluster.yaml`. 


## Worker Nodes

You decide what infrastructure is used for the vCluster's worker node pool.

### Using nodes from the shared host cluster

The following tenancy models use the worker nodes in the shared host cluster that the vCluster is deployed on. Enabling other features unlocks different levels of tenancy.  

* **[Namespace Syncing](./vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/advanced/namespaces)** - Enable syncing namespaces between the virtual cluster and host cluster. 
* **Shared Nodes** - (Default) All worker nodes of the shared host cluster are used by the virtual cluster and all resources are synced to the single namespace that the vCluster is deployed on. 
* **[Dedicated Nodes](./vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes)** - Select nodes using labels from the host cluster which are used as worker nodes for the virtual cluster.


### Joining individual nodes to the vCluster

THe following tenancy models use individual nodes that are joined indiviudally to the vCluster. 

* **[Private Nodes](./vcluster-yaml/private-nodes)** - Enable only adding individual nodes to the virtual cluster.
