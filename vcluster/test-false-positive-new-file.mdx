# Test False Positive: Brand New File

This is a completely new file created from scratch.
It has never existed before in the repository.
It should NOT trigger rename detection because there is no deletion.

## Purpose
Testing that `--diff-filter=R` does NOT detect new file creation as a rename.

## Expected Result
- Git status: `A` (Added) only
- Rename detection: Empty (no rename detected)
- Workflow: Should NOT trigger redirect automation
