# Snapshots

vCluster Platform allows you to configure taking snapshots of the vCluster at specific intervals. For detailed vCluster-specific auto snapshots configuration and examples, see the [vCluster auto snapshots documentation](../configure/vcluster-yaml/snapshots).

## View snapshots

After enabling automatic snapshots, you can view the list of snapshots for each virtual cluster in the details of the virtual cluster. This menu is only available for Project admins and Platform admins users.

### Snapshot name

Snapshots are identified by a generated name formatted as `<Virtual_Cluster_Name>-<Snapshot_Timestamp>.tar.gz`.

### Snapshot schedule lifecycle

Snapshots transition through different statuses as part of their execution lifecycle. A typical flow starts with the
 snapshot being in the `Scheduled` state, then moves to the `In Progress` state while it is being stored. If the snapshot and storage is successful,
  the snapshot moves to the `Completed` state. If an error occurs, the snapshot will be moved to a `Failed` state.

  If a snapshot was removed from the storage backend, but not in vCluster Platform, the snapshot appears in the `Not Found` state.

| Snapshot Status | Description |
| ---|---|
| `Scheduled` |  A snapshot that is scheduled to be stored in the storage backend service. Only one snapshot can have the Scheduled status at a time. |
| `In Progress` | A snapshot that is currently being stored in the storage backend service. |
| `Completed` | A snapshot that has been successfully stored in the storage backend service. |
| `Partially Failed` | A snapshot successfully stored in the storage backend service but failed to snapshot one or more volumes. (This will only occurs when volume snapshot is enabled) |
| `Failed` | A snapshot that failed to be taken. |
| `Not Found` | A snapshot that appears in the list but has been removed from the storage backend service. |

When volume snapshotting is enabled, there will be transitions between various volume snapshot phases. These phases represent the progress of snapshotting PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) and storing them.

| Snapshot Status | Description |
| ---|---|
| `Not Started` | Volume snapshot has not started yet. |
| `Skipped` | Volume snapshot was skipped due to being misconfigured. |
| `In Progress` | Volume snapshot is currently being snapshotted and stored in the backing store. |
| `Completed Cleaning Up` | When removing volume snapshot resources (VolumeSnapshot & VolumeSnapshotContent) after the volume has been successfully snapshotted. |
| `Failed Cleaning Up` | When removing volume snapshot resources (VolumeSnapshot & VolumeSnapshotContent) after the volume has failed to be snapshotted. |
| `Completed` | Volume snapshot was successfully taken |
| `Failed` | Volume snapshot failed to be taken |

These phases are displayed in the platform UI on the Snapshot View page and help to identify the current status of each volume snapshot. You can also refer to the [Troubleshoot Issues](/vcluster/next/manage/backup-restore/volume-snapshots/setup#troubleshoot-issues) section of the vCluster Volume Snapshot documentation to help identify and resolve potential issues.
