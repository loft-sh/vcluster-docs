The vCluster project provides several configuration options pertaining to virtual cluster
isolation and security. This section briefly covers the primary configuration options. For detailed
information, see the [policies configuration](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/policies/).

vCluster provides a configuration option simply named `isolate`. When enabled, this feature
enables a pod security standard, deploys a resource quota and limit range, and enables a network
policy to isolate workloads.

Enabling of the vCluster `isolate` configuration setting is as simple as setting the appropriate
value in your virtual cluster or virtual cluster template Helm values as shown below:

```yaml
policies:
  podSecurityStandard: "baseline"
  limitRange:
    enabled: true
  resourceQuota:
    enabled: true
```

All vCluster isolation mode configuration settings are available for further configuration by
making use of the provided Helm values. Take a look the vCluster docs linked below for much more
information about both the default settings and available configurations.

:::warning CNIs and Network Policies
Not all CNIs will support all network policies. Make sure you understand what capabilities your
CNI supports when investigating virtual cluster isolation.
