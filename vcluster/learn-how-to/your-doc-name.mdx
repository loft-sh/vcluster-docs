# Summary
Integrating the vCluster binary as a kubectl plugin enables Kubernetes users to manage their vClusters seamlessly via kubectl commands. 

## How-to steps
Install the vCluster CLI [documented here](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/#deploy-vcluster)

### On Mac/Linux
1. Locate the install vCluster binary using
```bash
where vcluster
```
The output should be `/usr/local/bin/vcluster`

2. Create a symlink to the binary with a new name kubectl-vcluster using
```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/vcluster /usr/local/bin/kubectl-vcluster
```

### On Windows

1. Locate the vcluster.exe binary using File Explorer. It should be in `C:\Users\<current user>\AppDatRoaming`

2. Copy the vCluster binary in the same location with the name 'kubectl-vcluster.exe'

## Testing the plugin

Run the command
```bash
kubectl vcluster --version
```

The output will show the vCluster binary installed version, for example:
```bash
vcluster version 0.21.2
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Found
- Ensure the renamed binary is in a directory included in your system's PATH.
- Run echo $PATH (macOS) or echo %PATH% (Windows) to verify the paths.

### Permission Denied

- macOS: Ensure the binary has executable permissions chmod +x.
- Windows: Verify the file permissions and PATH configuration.
