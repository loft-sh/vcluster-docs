import ProAdmonition from '../_partials/admonitions/pro-admonition.mdx'

When vCluster syncs real nodes from the host cluster, it obfuscates node IP addresses by default. This behavior protects sensitive information in multi-tenant environments while still providing node features.

Node IP obfuscation provides several benefits:

- **Security**: Prevents exposure of host cluster network topology in multi-tenant environments.
- **Privacy**: Protects sensitive infrastructure information from virtual cluster users.
- **Isolation**: Maintains logical separation between virtual and host clusters.

## Default behavior

By default, when you enable real node syncing:

```yaml title="Enable real node syncing"
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
```

vCluster automatically replaces the actual node IP addresses with obfuscated values. For example, if a host node has IP `192.168.1.100`, it appears in the virtual cluster with a generated IP like `10.0.0.1`.

## Control IP visibility with patches

<ProAdmonition/>

You can customize node syncing behavior using patches to control which information is visible in the virtual cluster.

### Preserve original node IPs

To sync real node IPs without obfuscation, use a patch that preserves the original values:

```yaml title="Preserve original node IPs"
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: status.addresses
        expression: |
          value
```

### Custom IP obfuscation

You can create custom obfuscation logic using JavaScript expressions:

```yaml title="Custom IP obfuscation"
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: status.addresses[*].address
        expression: |
          if (type === "InternalIP") {
            "10.0.0." + Math.floor(Math.random() * 254 + 1)
          } else {
            value
          }
```

### Remove IP information completely

To remove IP addresses entirely from synced nodes:

```yaml title="Remove IP addresses"
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: status.addresses
        expression: |
          []
```

## Advanced node information control

You can use patches to control other sensitive node information beyond IP addresses:

### Hide system information

```yaml title="Hide system information"
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: status.nodeInfo.bootID
        expression: '""'
      - path: status.nodeInfo.systemUUID
        expression: '""'
      - path: status.nodeInfo.machineID
        expression: '""'
```

### Selective field obfuscation

```yaml title="Selective obfuscation"
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: status.nodeInfo.osImage
        expression: '"Linux"'
      - path: status.nodeInfo.kernelVersion
        expression: '"Hidden"'
```

## Use node selectors

When using node selectors with obfuscated IPs, focus on labels rather than IP-based selection:

```yaml title="Node selector with labels"
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        labels:
          node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "true"
          environment: "production"
```

This approach ensures your workloads can still be scheduled appropriately without relying on specific IP addresses.

## Troubleshoot node IP issues

### Verify obfuscation

To check if IP obfuscation is working:

1. Compare node information between host and virtual clusters:

```bash title="Check host cluster node"
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

```bash title="Check virtual cluster node"
vcluster connect my-vcluster -- kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

2. Inspect node details:

```bash title="Inspect node details"
vcluster connect my-vcluster -- kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

### Common issues

- **Networking problems**: Some network policies or CNI plugins may require real IP addresses. Test thoroughly when modifying IP obfuscation.
- **Monitoring tools**: Tools that rely on node IPs may need adjustment when IPs are obfuscated.
- **Service discovery**: Services that use node IPs directly may require alternative approaches.

## Best practices

- **Default to obfuscation**: Keep IP obfuscation enabled unless you have specific requirements for real IPs.
- **Use labels**: Rely on node labels rather than IPs for workload scheduling and management.
- **Document changes**: Clearly document any modifications to default obfuscation behavior.
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify that your applications work correctly with obfuscated IPs before production deployment.
