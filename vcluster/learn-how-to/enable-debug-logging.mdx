# Enable debug logging in vCluster

Debug logging can be useful for troubleshooting issues in vCluster. This guide explains how to enable debug logging by modifying the vCluster configuration.

## Steps to Enable Debug Logging

### 1. Edit the vCluster Configuration

Open your vCluster configuration file (`vcluster.yaml`) or the Helm values file used during installation.

### 2. Add the Debug Flag

Modify the configuration to include the debug environment variable:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    env:
    - name: "DEBUG"
      value: "true"
```

### 3. Apply the Configuration

Run the following command to apply the updated configuration:

```yaml
helm upgrade <vcluster-helm-release-name> loft/vcluster -n <vcluster-namespace> -f vcluster.yaml
```

## Conclusion

Enabling debug logging in vCluster helps diagnose and resolve issues more effectively. By adding the `DEBUG` environment variable to the vCluster configuration, you increase log verbosity and gain deeper insights into the systemâ€™s behavior.
