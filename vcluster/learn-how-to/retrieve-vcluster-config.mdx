<!-- vale off -->

You can deploy vCluster using Helm, CLI, ArgoCD, and many other tools. 
You might need to see the configuration of an already deployed vCluster when you don't have access to the original config file.

## View the configuration

### Use the vCluster CLI

The recommended way to retrieve the configuration is with the vCluster command line tool using the following command:

```bash
vcluster describe <VCLUSTER NAME> --namespace <VCLUSTER NAMESPACE> -o yaml
```

### Use kubectl

If you don't have the vCluster CLI available, you can access the configuration directly through kubectl:

```bash
kubectl exec --context=[HOST CONTEXT] -n [VCLUSTER NAMESPACE] [VCLUSTER POD NAME]
```
