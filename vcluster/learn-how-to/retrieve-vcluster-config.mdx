You can deploy vCluster using various tools including Helm charts, the vCluster CLI, ArgoCD, Flux, or other GitOps workflows. After deployment, you may need to inspect the actual configuration of a running vCluster instance when the original Helm values or deployment files are no longer available. This helps with debugging issues, understanding configuration drift, or replicating the setup in another environment.

The following methods provide different levels of detail depending on your deployment approach and available tools.

<TabItem value="cli" label="vCluster CLI" default>

The vCluster CLI provides the most comprehensive view of your cluster configuration, showing both user-defined settings and applied defaults. The follwoing command is recommended when you need the complete effective configuration that vCluster uses to manage your virtual cluster:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock 
  code={`vcluster describe [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAME:my-vcluster]] --namespace [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAMESPACE:vcluster-my-vcluster]] -o yaml`}
  language="bash"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="helm" label="Helm">

For Helm-managed deployments, retrieve the configuration values used during installation and upgrades.

To get only user-defined values:

:::note
This command shows only the values you explicitly set
:::

<InterpolatedCodeBlock 
  code={`helm get values [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAME:my-vcluster]] -n [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAMESPACE:vcluster-my-vcluster]] -o yaml`}
  language="bash"
/>

To get merged default and user values:

:::note
This provides the complete configuration including defaults that Helm applied to your deployment.
:::

<InterpolatedCodeBlock 
  code={`helm get values [[VAR:VCLUSTER_NAME:my-vcluster]] -n [[VAR:VCLUSTER_NAMESPACE:vcluster-my-vcluster]] -a -o yaml`}
  language="bash"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kubectl" label="kubectl">

When you don't have access to the vCluster CLI or Helm, you can read the configuration directly from the running vCluster pod.

<InterpolatedCodeBlock 
  code={`kubectl exec --context=[[VAR:HOST CONTEXT:my-host-cluster]] -n [[VAR:VCLUSTER NAMESPACE:vcluster-my-vcluster]] [[VAR:VCLUSTER POD NAME:my-vcluster-0]] -it -- cat /var/lib/vcluster/config.yaml`}
  language="bash"
/>

This approach accesses the actual configuration file that vCluster uses internally, though it requires more manual interpretation.

:::warning Version note
In vCluster versions before v0.26, the path was `/var/vcluster/config.yaml`. Starting in v0.26, the file moved to `/var/lib/vcluster/config.yaml` to align with common Kubernetes conventions.
