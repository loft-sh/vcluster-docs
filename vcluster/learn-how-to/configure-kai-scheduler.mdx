# Configure NVIDIA KAI scheduler with vCluster {#configure-kai-scheduler-with-vCluster}

This guide explains how to configure vCluster to work with the [NVIDIA KAI scheduler](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler). KAI is a Kubernetes scheduler that optimizes resource allocation for both GPU and CPU workloads, with advanced queuing, fractional GPU allocation, and topology awareness.

:::info NVIDIA KAI scheduler background
NVIDIA KAI scheduler is the open source version of Run:AI's scheduler technology, which is why it uses `podgroups.scheduling.run.ai` CRDs. KAI was open sourced by NVIDIA in 2025 under the Apache 2.0 license.
:::

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
<BasePrerequisites />
- KAI scheduler installed in the <GlossaryTerm term="host-cluster">host cluster</GlossaryTerm>

## Understand the challenge {#understand-the-challenge}

By default, when syncing workload pods from a vCluster to the host cluster, vCluster sets ownership references on the synced pods. When using custom schedulers like KAI, this causes issues because:

- KAI's pod-grouper controller watches for pods with `schedulerName: kai-scheduler`
- The pod-grouper controller traverses the owner references to group related pods
- For vCluster workloads, the owner reference is set to the vCluster service in the host namespace
- The pod-grouper may not have sufficient permissions to access these Service resources

## Solution: Configure vCluster for KAI scheduler {#solution-configure-vCluster-for-kai}

To properly integrate vCluster with KAI scheduler, you need to configure one thing:

**Turn off owner references** to allow KAI's pod-grouper to process pods properly.

Add the following to your vCluster configuration (`values.yaml` for Helm or vCluster config):

```yaml title="vCluster configuration for KAI scheduler"
# highlight-start
experimental:
  syncSettings:
    setOwner: false
# highlight-end
```

This configuration prevents owner reference traversal issues by not setting them on synced pods. The KAI scheduler's pod-grouper controller automatically creates PodGroup resources in the host cluster.

Apply this configuration when creating or updating your vCluster:

```bash title="Create vCluster with KAI scheduler configuration"
vcluster create my-vcluster --values kai-scheduler-values.yaml
```

Or for an existing vCluster, update the configuration:

```bash title="Update existing vCluster configuration"
vcluster create --upgrade my-vcluster --values kai-scheduler-values.yaml
```

Where `kai-scheduler-values.yaml` contains the configuration shown previously.

## Use KAI scheduler for vCluster workloads {#use-kai-scheduler-for-workloads}

After applying this configuration, you can use the KAI scheduler for your vCluster workloads by specifying `schedulerName: kai-scheduler` in the pod specification.

### Example: CPU-only workload {#example-cpu-only-workload}
<!-- vale on -->

Here's an example of a CPU-only pod using the KAI scheduler:

```yaml title="CPU-only pod with KAI scheduler"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: cpu-only-pod
spec:
  # highlight-start
  schedulerName: kai-scheduler
  # highlight-end
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: ubuntu
    args:
    - sleep
    - infinity
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 250M
```


<!-- vale off -->
### Example: GPU workload {#example-gpu-workload}
<!-- vale on -->

Here's an example of a GPU pod using the KAI scheduler:

```yaml title="GPU pod with KAI scheduler"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  # highlight-start
  schedulerName: kai-scheduler
  # highlight-end
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: ubuntu
    command:
    - /bin/bash
    - -c
    - nvidia-smi && sleep infinity
    resources:
      requests:
        nvidia.com/gpu: '1'
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: '1'
```

<!-- vale off -->
### Example: Fractional GPU workload {#example-fractional-gpu-workload}
<!-- vale on -->

KAI scheduler supports GPU sharing through fractional allocation. Here's an example using half a GPU:

```yaml title="Fractional GPU pod with KAI scheduler"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-sharing-pod
  labels:
    kai.scheduler/queue: test  # Optional: specify queue
  annotations:
    # highlight-start
    gpu-fraction: "0.5"  # Request half of a GPU
    # highlight-end
spec:
  schedulerName: kai-scheduler
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: ubuntu
    args: ["sleep", "infinity"]
```

:::info GPU sharing notes
- GPU sharing must be enabled during KAI installation with `--set "global.gpuSharing=true"`
- KAI doesn't enforce memory isolation - applications should respect their allocation
- You can also use `gpu-memory: "2000"` annotation to request specific MiB
:::

## Verify configuration {#verify-configuration}

To verify that the KAI scheduler is properly configured with vCluster:

- Confirm vCluster is using `experimental.syncSettings.setOwner=false` in its configuration

- Check that pods are being scheduled by KAI scheduler:
  ```bash title="Verify pod is using KAI scheduler"
  kubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.schedulerName}'
  ```

- Ensure the KAI scheduler components are running:
  ```bash title="Check KAI scheduler components"
  kubectl get pods -n kai-scheduler
  ```

:::info Scheduler behavior
When using the KAI scheduler with vCluster and `setOwner: false`, you may observe:

1. The pod-grouper adds a podgroup annotation to your pod:
```
Annotations: pod-group-name: pg-pod-name-[uuid]
```

2. You might see a non-blocking message in the logs:
```
Detected pod with no owner but with podgroup annotation
```
This is expected and doesn't affect scheduling.

The `setOwner: false` configuration successfully resolves owner reference issues and allows the KAI scheduler to work properly with vCluster workloads in production environments.
:::

## How it works {#how-it-works}

The KAI scheduler's pod-grouper component is a controller that:
- Watches pods with `schedulerName: kai-scheduler`
- Traverses the owner references to find the topmost owner
- Groups related pods for optimal scheduling decisions
- Applies custom scheduling logic based on workload type

When vCluster syncs pods to the host cluster, it sets an owner reference to the vCluster service by default. By disabling this with `setOwner: false`, the pod-grouper can process the pods normally without needing to follow service references.

## Limitations and considerations {#limitations-and-considerations}

- The `experimental.syncSettings.setOwner: false` configuration is marked as experimental and may change in future vCluster releases
- If you have other features that rely on pod ownership in vCluster, disabling owner references may affect those features
- The KAI scheduler might require additional configuration for advanced features like GPU sharing and queue management
- For GPU workloads, ensure that the host cluster has the necessary GPU drivers and device plugins installed

## Troubleshoot common issues {#troubleshooting}

### Common problems {#common-problems}

1. **GPU sharing pods stuck in pending**:
   - Verify GPU sharing is enabled: `--set "global.gpuSharing=true"` during KAI installation
   - Check if reservation pods are created in `kai-resource-reservation` namespace

2. **Pod-grouper permission errors**:
   - With `setOwner: false`, these should not occur
   - If they persist, check KAI scheduler logs: `kubectl logs -n kai-scheduler -l component=scheduler`
