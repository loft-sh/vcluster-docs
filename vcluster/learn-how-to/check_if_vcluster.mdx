When working with Kubernetes clusters, it's sometimes necessary to determine programmatically whether you're connected to a vcluster (virtual cluster) or the host cluster. This article outlines several methods to achieve this.

# Method 1: Check for vcluster node labels
One approach is to retrieve the nodes and check for a vcluster node label:
```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep vcluster
```
If this command returns results, you're likely connected to a vcluster. However, this method may not always be 100% reliable.

# Method 2: Examine the current context
For scripting purposes, you can check the current context:
```
kubectl config current-context
```
If the output contains "vcluster" (e.g., "vcluster_vcluster-xx5gk"), you're connected to a vcluster.

# Method 3: Parse all contexts
To get a more comprehensive view, you can list all contexts and search for "vcluster":
```
kubectl config get-contexts | grep vcluster
```
This will show all vcluster contexts available.

# Implementing in a script

Here's a simple bash script that combines these methods:
```
#!/bin/bash

# Check current context
current_context=$(kubectl config current-context)
if [[ $current_context == *"vcluster"* ]]; then
    echo "Connected to vcluster: $current_context"
    exit 0
fi

# Check for vcluster node labels
vcluster_nodes=$(kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep vcluster)
if [ ! -z "$vcluster_nodes" ]; then
    echo "Connected to vcluster (detected via node labels)"
    exit 0
fi

echo "Connected to host cluster"
exit 1
```

This script first checks the current context name. If that doesn't indicate a vcluster, it then checks for vcluster node labels. If neither method detects a vcluster, it assumes you're connected to the host cluster.

## Additional tools

While not directly applicable for scripting, tools like kubectx can be helpful for manual context switching and management:
- Install kubectl plugins using [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/)
- Use [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) for easier context switching

These tools can be particularly useful when working with multiple clusters or contexts in a development environment.
