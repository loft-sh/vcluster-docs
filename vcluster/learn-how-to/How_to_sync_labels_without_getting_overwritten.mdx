**Issue**  
vCluster version 0.20 or earlier does not sync labels to the host cluster.

This issue impacts workflows that depend on accurate label-based targeting, such as monitoring, logging, or service discovery.

---

**Solution**

In **vCluster version \< 0.21.x**, you can selectively sync labels from the virtual cluster to the host cluster using the feature `experimental.syncSettings.syncLabels` . With it you can specify which labels should be synced to the host, ensuring critical labels are preserved in vCluster and the host cluster.

Starting **vCluster version 0.21.x**, all labels are synced by default. This eliminates the need for manually configuring synchronization of specific labels and ensures a seamless synchronization process for all labels.

**Configuration Example for vCluster \< 0.21.x**

To use the experimental `syncLabels` feature, configure your Helm values file with the following settings:

```
yaml
experimental:
  syncSettings:
    syncLabels:
      - 'namespace'            # Sync labels related to namespaces
      - 'example.com/*'         # Sync all labels with the 'example.com/' prefix
      - 'example.com/'          # Sync a specific label starting with 'example.com/'
```
