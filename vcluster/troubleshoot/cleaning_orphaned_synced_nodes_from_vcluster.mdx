## Problem

When node syncing is enabled in vCluster without a specified node selector, nodes will be synced to the vCluster based on where the pods are scheduled.

If a node selector is configured later, previously synced nodes are not automatically cleaned up after the vCluster restarts. This can lead to outdated or unnecessary nodes showing in vCluster.

## Solution

You can manually clean up these unnecessary nodes using the following command within the vCluster context:

`kubectl delete node <node-name>`

If any pods are running on these nodes, they will be allocated to different nodes.

Refer to the [documentation](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes) to explore the various options for syncing nodes to a vCluster.
