title: "Configuring CPU & Memory Limits for vCluster via UI and CLI"
---

## Problem

When using quota limits in your vCluster project, you may encounter the following error:

```plaintext
FailedCreate
create Pod vclusterpod-0 in StatefulSet vclusterpod failed error: admission webhook "quota.loft.sh" denied the request: pods "vclusterpod-0" is forbidden: failed quota: project-quota-test: must specify limits.cpu
```

## Solution

### Configuring Limits via the vCluster Platform UI

1. Log in to the vCluster platform.
2. Deploy vCluster using the vCluster platform method.

3. Click on **Create vCluster** and in `vcluster.yaml`, use the following configuration (adjust CPU and memory limits as needed):

   ```yaml
   controlPlane:
     statefulSet:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpu: "1" 
           memory: "2Gi"
   ```

4. Create the vCluster.

### Configuring Limits via the vCluster CLI

1. Create a configuration file locally with the following settings (adjust CPU and memory limits as needed):

   ```yaml
   controlPlane:
     statefulSet:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpu: "1" 
           memory: "2Gi"
   ```

2. Deploy the vCluster using the following command:

   ```sh
   vcluster create vcdemo2 --values vcdemo2values.yaml
   ```

## Validate Your work

Since vCluster is deployed as a StatefulSet, use the following command to verify resource limits:

```sh
kubectl get statefulset -n <vc-namespace> <vc-name> -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].resources.limits}"
