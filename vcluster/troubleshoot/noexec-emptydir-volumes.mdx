# Resolve permission denied errors with noexec volumes

When deploying <GlossaryTerm term="vcluster">vCluster</GlossaryTerm> in Kubernetes environments where emptyDir volumes are mounted with `noexec` flag, the vCluster pod fails to start with permission denied errors. This occurs because vCluster uses init containers to copy Kubernetes binaries into emptyDir volumes, and these binaries cannot be executed when the volume is mounted with `noexec`.

## Error messages

The following error messages indicate this issue:

```bash title="Container runtime error"
Error: failed to create containerd task: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: 
runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: "/binaries/vcluster": permission denied: unknown
```

```bash title="When debugging with strace"
/ # /binaries/vcluster
sh: /binaries/vcluster: Permission denied
/ # strace /binaries/vcluster
execve("/binaries/vcluster", ["/binaries/vcluster"], [/* 27 vars */]) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
```

## Cause

vCluster uses init containers to copy the vCluster binary and Kubernetes components (kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager) into emptyDir volumes. The main container then attempts to execute these binaries. When emptyDir volumes are mounted with `noexec`, the binaries cannot be executed.

This happens in:
- Security-hardened Kubernetes environments
- Clusters where the host filesystem for emptyDir has `noexec` mount option
- Environments with security policies enforcing `noexec` on temporary storage

## Solution

### Use pre-built images with embedded binaries

The most reliable solution is to use vCluster images that have all required binaries embedded directly in the container image, eliminating the need for emptyDir volumes.

:::info Temporary workaround available
A temporary workaround using pre-built images is available:
- GitHub workflow: https://github.com/loft-demos/<GlossaryTerm term="k8s">k8s</GlossaryTerm>-image-mirror/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-vcluster.yaml
- Pre-built images: https://github.com/loft-demos/k8s-image-mirror/pkgs/container/vcluster-pro
- Helm charts: https://loft-demos.github.io/vcluster-charts/
:::

```bash title="Add alternative Helm repository and deploy"
# Add the alternative Helm repository
helm repo add vcluster-prebuilt https://loft-demos.github.io/vcluster-charts/
helm repo update

# Deploy vCluster with pre-built images
helm install my-vcluster vcluster-prebuilt/vcluster \
  --namespace vcluster-namespace \
  --create-namespace
```

Or specify the image directly in your values file:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
# Use pre-built image with embedded binaries
controlPlane:
  distro:
    k8s:
      image:
        repository: ghcr.io/loft-demos/vcluster-pro
        tag: <version>-noexec
```

## Alternative solutions

If pre-built images aren't available or suitable:

### Configure volume mounts without noexec

If you have cluster admin access, modify the mount options for the emptyDir base directory:

```bash title="Remount with exec permissions"
# On the Kubernetes node
mount -o remount,exec /var/lib/kubelet
```

### Use persistent volumes

Configure vCluster to use persistent storage instead of emptyDir:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    persistence:
      volumeClaim:
        enabled: true
        size: 10Gi
```

### Deploy to specific nodes

Deploy to nodes that allow exec on emptyDir:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    scheduling:
      nodeSelector:
        vcluster-compatible: "true"
```

## Verification

After implementing a solution:

```bash title="Verify vCluster deployment"
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n <vcluster-namespace>

# Check logs for permission errors
kubectl logs -n <vcluster-namespace> <vcluster-pod> -c syncer

# Connect to vCluster
vcluster connect <vcluster-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl get nodes
```

## Known limitations

- **No direct upgrade path**: Cannot upgrade from standard deployment to pre-built images without recreating vCluster
- **Image size**: Pre-built images are larger than standard images
- **Maintenance overhead**: Custom images require additional maintenance

## Best practices

- Check cluster policies before deploying vCluster
- Use pre-built images in security-hardened environments
- Test in staging environments matching production security policies
