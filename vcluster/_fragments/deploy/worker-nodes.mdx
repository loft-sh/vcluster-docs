### Worker Nodes

Decide where you want your worker nodes to come from:

- **[Nodes from the host cluster](../../worker-nodes/shared-nodes)** - (Default) All worker nodes of the shared host cluster are used by the virtual cluster and all resources are synced to the single namespace that the vCluster is deployed on.
  - **[Syncing Namespaces](../../../vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes)** - Resources are synced to mapped namespaces on the host cluster.
- **[Private Nodes](../../worker-nodes/private-nodes)** - Enable adding individual nodes to the virtual cluster.
