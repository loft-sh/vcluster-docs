### Control Plane Options

* [High availability](./high-availability) - Run multiple control plane nodes
* [Core DNS](../../../configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/coredns) - Currently only coreDNS deployed by vCluster during startup is supported.
* Backing Store - Decide how the data of your cluster is stored, must be one of either [embedded SQLite](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/database/sqlite) (the default) or [embedded etcd](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/embedded).
