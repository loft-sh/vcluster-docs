### Control Plane Options

Decide the various options of how you want your control plane deployed:

- **[High availability](./topologies/high-availability)** - Run multiple copies of vCluster components.
- **[Rootless mode](./security/rootless-mode)** - Deploy the vCluster pod without root access to the host cluster.
- **Backing Store** - Decide how the data of your cluster is stored.
