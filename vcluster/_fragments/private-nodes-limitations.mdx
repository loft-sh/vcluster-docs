### Other vCluster feature limitations

Certain vCluster features are automatically disabled or unavailable. If you include these options in your `vcluster.yaml`, they are ignored or might cause configuration errors.

The following features are not available:

- `sync.*` - No resource syncing between virtual and host clusters
- `integrations.*` - Integrations depend on syncing functionality
- `networking.replicateServices` - Services are not replicated to host
- `controlPlane.distro.k3s` - Only standard Kubernetes (k8s) is supported
- `controlPlane.coredns.embedded: true` - Embedded CoreDNS conflicts with custom CNI
- `controlPlane.advanced.virtualScheduler.enabled: false` - Virtual scheduler cannot be disabled
- `sleepMode.*` - No ability to sleep workloads or control plane
