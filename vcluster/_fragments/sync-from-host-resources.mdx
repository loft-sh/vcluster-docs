vCluster can sync certain resources purely from host to make them available inside the vCluster. This is useful if you only want to view certain resources in read-only mode, but not want the users inside the vCluster to change them.

A good example would be nodes, which are nice to view inside the vCluster and can be also used to enabled certain features such as [scheduling inside the vCluster](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/other/advanced/virtual-scheduler.mdx), but you wouldn't want your vCluster to change the node itself. Another benefit of purely syncing from host is that vCluster itself will only require read-only RBAC permissions.

vCluster also allows to sync custom resources via the [custom resource definitions syncer](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/custom-resources.mdx)
