You can create an ingress in a virtual cluster to make a service in that virtual cluster available via a hostname/domain. Instead of having to run a separate ingress controller in each virtual cluster, you can sync the ingress resource to the underlying host cluster, which means that the virtual cluster can use a shared ingress controller that is running in the host cluster. 

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```

Because the syncer keeps typical SSL provisioning-related annotations for ingresses, you can also set the cert-manager ingress annotations on an ingress in your virtual cluster to use the cert-manager of the underlying host cluster to automatically provision SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.
