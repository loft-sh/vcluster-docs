### Steps

<Flow id="sleepmode-deployment-example" title="Sleep Mode Deployment Example" description="This example demonstrates how to configure and manage sleep mode functionality in virtual clusters without using an agent.">

<Step>

Create the kind cluster

```shell title="create kind cluster"
kind create cluster --name sleep-mode-demo
```

</Step>

<Step>
Deploy a virtual cluster.

Use the following `vcluster.yaml` to create a virtual cluster on your host.  Save this file as `vcluster.yaml`

<CodeBlock title="vCluster config for auto sleep" language="yaml">{SleepmodeDeploymentConfig}</CodeBlock>

And run:

```bash title="Create vCluster with autoSleep config"
vcluster create my-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml
```

Note that under the exclude section, workloads with the label `sleep: no-thanks` won't be put to sleep after the 30 seconds.
So lets put that to the test.
</Step>

<Step>

Create demo deployments in your virtual cluster.

Use the following deployment yaml to create two deployments

<CodeBlock title="example deployments" language="yaml">{SleepModeDeploymentExample}</CodeBlock>


The first deployment has nothing special about it related to sleep mode.  Feel free to use another in its place if you'd
prefer.  The second has the special label **on the** `Deployment`.  As a result the `Deployment` won't be scaled down after the `30 seconds`.

You can verify this by waiting `30 seconds` and then getting information about the `Deployments`.  For example
</Step>


<Step>
Verify `Deployments` sleep status.

```bash title="deployment sleep check"
> sleep 30; kubectl get deployments
NAMESPACE     NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
default       no-sleep-deployment   2/2     2            2           1m
default       sleepy-deployment     0/2     0            0           1m
```

The `sleepy-deployment` reports `0/2` replicas after the 30 seconds.  The act of running `kubectl` counts as cluster activity,
which is why its reporting `0/2` not `0/0`.  `kubectl` has triggered `vCluster` to update the replicas count back to the original 2,
they just haven't become ready in the time it took for `kubectl get ...` to return.

</Step>

</Flow>

## Try the following

Experiment with the sleep mode feature by trying the following:

 - Add the `sleep: no-thanks` label to the first deployment and verify neither sleeps.
 - Remove the `sleep: no-thanks` label from both the deployments and verify that both go to sleep.
