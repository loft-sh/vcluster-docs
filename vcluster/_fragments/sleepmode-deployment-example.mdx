#### Tools used in this example
 - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 - [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)

#### Steps in this example

 - [Create a kind cluster](#dep-kind-create)
 - [Create a virtual cluster with sleepMode enabled, and a label exclusion configured.](#dep-vcluster-create)
 - [Install two `Deployments` with 2 replicas to verify sleep/wake, one with labels to exclude it from sleeping.](#deployments-install)
 - [Show one `Deployment` is scaled down after the `30 second` inactivity timeout, while the other remains active.](#dep-verify)
 - [Show that the slept `Deployment` wakes when the cluster is accessed with `kubectl`.](#dep-verify)

### 1. Create the kind cluster {#dep-kind-create}

```shell title="create kind cluster"
kind create cluster --name sleep-mode-demo
```
### 2. Create the vCluster {#dep-vcluster-create}

Use the following `vcluster.yaml` to create a virtual cluster on your host.  Save this file as `vcluster.yaml`

<CodeBlock title="vCluster config for auto sleep" language="yaml">{SleepmodeDeploymentConfig}</CodeBlock>

And run:

```bash title="Create vCluster with autoSleep config"
vcluster create my-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml
```

Note that under the exclude section, workloads with the label `sleep: no-thanks` won't be put to sleep after the 30 seconds.
So lets put that to the test.

### 3. Create a couple demo deployments in your virtual cluster {#deployments-install}

Use the following deployment yaml to create two deployments

<CodeBlock title="example deployments" language="yaml">{SleepModeDeploymentExample}</CodeBlock>


The first deployment has nothing special about it related to sleep mode.  Feel free to use another in its place if you'd
prefer.  The second has the special label **on the** `Deployment`.  As a result the `Deployment` won't be scaled down after the `30 seconds`.

You can verify this by waiting `30 seconds` and then getting information about the `Deployments`.  For example


### 4. Verify `Deployments` sleep status {#dep-verify}

```bash title="deployment sleep check"
> sleep 30; kubectl get deployments
NAMESPACE     NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
default       no-sleep-deployment   2/2     2            2           1m
default       sleepy-deployment     0/2     0            0           1m
```

The `sleepy-deployment` reports `0/2` replicas after the 30 seconds.  The act of running `kubectl` counts as cluster activity,
which is why its reporting `0/2` not `0/0`.  `kubectl` has triggered `vCluster` to update the replicas count back to the original 2,
they just haven't become ready in the time it took for `kubectl get ...` to return.


#### Things to try on your own with this setup

 - Add the `sleep: no-thanks` label to the first deployment and verify neither sleeps.
 - Remove the `sleep: no-thanks` label from both the deployments and verify that both go to sleep.
