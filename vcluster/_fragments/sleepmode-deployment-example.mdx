### Configure sleep mode for a deployment resource

A deployment resource in Kubernetes manages a set of identical pods. When configuring sleep mode for a deployment, the objective is to scale down the pods while keeping the control plane active. This setup allows the vCluster to reduce resource usage while still being able to monitor activity and trigger wake-up actions when needed.

<Flow id="sleepmode-deployment-example" title="Sleep mode deployment example" description="This example demonstrates how to configure and manage sleep mode functionality in virtual clusters without using an agent.">

<Step>

Create the `kind` cluster.

```shell title="create kind cluster"
kind create cluster --name sleep-mode-demo
```

</Step>

<Step>
Deploy a virtual cluster.

Use the following `vcluster.yaml` to create a virtual cluster on your host. Save this file as `vcluster.yaml`

<CodeBlock title="vCluster config for auto sleep" language="yaml">{SleepmodeDeploymentConfig}</CodeBlock>

And run the following command:

```bash title="Create vCluster with autoSleep config"
vcluster create my-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml
```

  :::note 
  Under the exclude section, workloads with the label `sleep: no-thanks` don't enter sleep mode after 30 seconds.
  :::
</Step>

<Step>

Create demo deployments in your virtual cluster.

Use the following deployment YAML to create two deployments.

<CodeBlock title="Example deployments" language="yaml">{SleepModeDeploymentExample}</CodeBlock>

The first deployment does not have any special configurations for sleep mode. You can replace it with another deployment if needed. The second deployment includes a special label on the `Deployment`, preventing it from scaling down after 30 seconds.

You can verify this by waiting `30 seconds` and then getting information about the `Deployments`.  For example
</Step>

<Step>
Verify `Deployments` sleep status.

```bash title="deployment sleep check"
> sleep 30; kubectl get deployments
NAMESPACE     NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
default       no-sleep-deployment   2/2     2            2           1m
default       sleepy-deployment     0/2     0            0           1m
```

The `sleepy-deployment` reports `0/2` replicas after 30 seconds. Running `kubectl` counts as cluster activity, which is why it reports `0/2` instead of `0/0`. The `kubectl` command triggers `vCluster` to update the replica count back to the original value of 2, but the replicas haven't become ready by the time `kubectl get ...` returns.

</Step>

</Flow>

## Next steps

Experiment with the sleep mode feature by trying the following:

 - Add the `sleep: no-thanks` label to the first deployment and verify neither sleeps.
 - Remove the `sleep: no-thanks` label from both the deployments and verify that both go to sleep.
