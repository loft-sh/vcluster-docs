### Configure auto sleep for a deployment resource

<Flow id="sleepmode-deployment-example" title="Auto sleep deployment example" description="This example demonstrates how to configure and manage auto sleep functionality in virtual clusters without using an agent.">

<Step>

Create the `kind` cluster.

```shell title="create kind cluster"
kind create cluster --name sleep-mode-demo
```

</Step>

<Step>
Deploy a virtual cluster.

Use the following `vcluster.yaml` to create a virtual cluster on your host. Save this file as `vcluster.yaml`

<CodeBlock title="vCluster config for auto sleep" language="yaml">{SleepmodeDeploymentConfig}</CodeBlock>

And run the following command:

```bash title="Create vCluster with autoSleep config"
vcluster create my-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml
```

Workloads with the label `sleep: no-thanks` don't enter auto sleep after 30 seconds.

</Step>

<Step>

Create demo deployments in your virtual cluster.

Use the following deployment YAML to create two deployments.

<CodeBlock title="Example deployments" language="yaml">{SleepModeDeploymentExample}</CodeBlock>

The first deployment does not have any special configurations for auto sleep. You can replace it with another deployment if needed. The second deployment includes a special label on the Deployment, preventing it from scaling down after 30 seconds.

You can verify this by waiting `30 seconds` and then getting information about the Deployments.  For example
</Step>

<Step>
Verify Deployments sleep status.

```bash title="deployment sleep check"
> sleep 30; kubectl get deployments
NAMESPACE     NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
default       no-sleep-deployment   2/2     2            2           1m
default       sleepy-deployment     0/2     0            0           1m
```

The `sleepy-deployment` reports `0/2` replicas after 30 seconds. Running `kubectl` counts as cluster activity, which is why it reports `0/2` instead of `0/0`. The `kubectl` command triggers `vCluster` to update the replica count back to the original value of 2, but the replicas haven't become ready by the time `kubectl get ...` returns.

</Step>

</Flow>

#### Next steps

Experiment with the auto sleep feature by trying the following:

 - Add the `sleep: no-thanks` label to the first deployment and verify neither sleeps.
 - Remove the `sleep: no-thanks` label from both the deployments and verify that both go to sleep.
