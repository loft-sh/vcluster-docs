Since a virtual cluster does not have actual worker nodes or a network, syncing is the process where vCluster copies a resource between the virtual cluster and the host cluster. 
It's the basic principle that vCluster uses to emulate a fully functional Kubernetes cluster. 

By default, vCluster only syncs low-level resources, such as pods, secrets, configmaps, or services, but a user can 
enable many other resources for all use cases. vCluster control plane runs with a minimal set of RBAC permissions to allow execution in restricted environments. Certain resources require 
extra permissions to sync, which are automatically given to the vCluster ServiceAccount if you enable a resource that requires additional 
permissions. 

All fields of a resources are synced from either the virtual cluster to the host cluster or the inverse (i.e. from the host cluster to the virtual cluster). The direction on how
the sync of the resources is based on what section the resource is part of in the `vcluster.yaml`. There 
are a few exceptions for each resource where specific fields are kept in sync in both directions (i.e. bi-directional sync). 

If the resource is being asked to sync from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, vCluster copies the resources from the vCluster and sends it to the host cluster to be created. There are 
a couple of additional labels added to the host cluster resource object for vCluster to keep it in sync. The syncer starts watching for changes to the resource on either side. When the resource
is updated in the virtual cluster, the syncer copies those changes in host cluster. 

When a resource is defined in the `toHost` section, as soon as that resource is created in the virtual cluster, vCluster copies it to the host cluster. 
Any changes to the resource in the virtual cluster are automatically applied to the resource in the host cluster.

When a resource is defined in the `fromHost` section, as soon as that resource is created in the host cluster, vCluster copies it to the virtual cluster. 
Any changes to the resource in the host cluster are automatically applied to the resource in the virtual cluster.


When syncing resources, vCluster stores the mapping of the `VIRTUAL NAME <-> HOST NAME` for the actual resource, and the references of the other resources used by this resource. 
Tracking references helps the vCluster to understand what resources are still needed in the host cluster. This important for secrets and configmaps because by default only the secrets and configmaps used by pods are actually synced to the host cluster.

Assume you've started your vCluster with ingress syncing to the host enabled. 

``` vcluster.yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```

After the virtual cluster is up, the user creates an ingress in the virtual cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
      - https-example.foo.com
    secretName: testsecret-tls
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
        backend:
          service:
            name: nginx
            port:
              number: 80
```

When vCluster copies the ingress to the host cluster, the vCluster creates an ingress in the namespace of the virtual cluster with the following changes:

* **Name Rewritten**: vCluster rewrites the name of the resource to avoid conflicts in the host cluster. The name is rewritten in the form of `NAME-x-NAMESPACE-x-VCLUSTER_NAME`
* **Namespace Rewritten**: vCluster rewrites the namespace of the resource to sync everything into the namespace of the deployed virtual cluster control plane.
* **Annotations / Labels Added**: vCluster adds annotations and labels to identify the resource in the host cluster, which are pre-fixed with `vcluster.loft.sh/`.
* **References Rewritten**: vCluster rewrites the `spec.rules[*].http.paths[*].backend.service.name` and `spec.tls[*].secretName` to match the rewritten names of the resources in the host cluster.


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-host-name: nginx-x-default-x-vcluster
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-host-namespace: vcluster
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-kind: networking.k8s.io/v1, Kind=Ingress
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-name: nginx
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-namespace: default
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-uid: bb8bea39-8c0c-4295-8616-6a20b3b1900a
  labels:
    vcluster.loft.sh/managed-by: vcluster
    vcluster.loft.sh/namespace: default
  name: nginx-x-default-x-vcluster
  namespace: vcluster
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: nginx-x-default-x-vcluster
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - https-example.foo.com
    secretName: testsecret-tls-x-default-x-vcluster
```

### Syncing labels to the host cluster

When syncing labels to the host cluster, vCluster rewrites the following labels to avoid conflicts:

* `release` (Label is needed to avoid conflicts with the vCluster pods themselves). This is only excluded in single-namespace mode as multi-namespace mode does sync all pods into separate namespaces.
* `vcluster.loft.sh/namespace`
* `vcluster.loft.sh/managed-by`
* `vcluster.loft.sh/controlled-by`
