Since a virtual cluster lacks actual worker nodes and its own network, syncing is the process by which vCluster replicates resources between the virtual cluster and the host cluster. 
This functionality is handled by a component called the syncer, deployed by vCluster. The syncer is the core mechanism that enables vCluster to emulate a fully functional Kubernetes cluster. 
When the syncer fails or malfunctions, it can lead to resource inconsistencies, application failures, state drift, and operational errors.

By default, vCluster only syncs low-level resources, such as pods, secrets, configmaps, or services, but a user can 
enable many other resources for all use cases. vCluster control plane runs with a minimal set of RBAC permissions to allow execution in restricted environments. Certain resources require 
extra permissions to sync, which are automatically given to the vCluster ServiceAccount if you enable a resource that requires additional 
permissions. 

All fields of a resources are synced from either the virtual cluster to the host cluster or the inverse (i.e. from the host cluster to the virtual cluster). The direction on how
the sync of the resources is based on what section the resource is part of in the `vcluster.yaml`. There 
are a few exceptions for each resource where specific fields are kept in sync in both directions (i.e. bi-directional sync). 

If the resource is being asked to sync from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, vCluster copies the resources from the vCluster and sends it to the host cluster to be created. There are 
a couple of additional labels added to the host cluster resource object for vCluster to keep it in sync. The syncer starts watching for changes to the resource on either side. When the resource
is updated in the virtual cluster, the syncer copies those changes in host cluster. 

:::warning Syncing will overwrite resources
When you enable a sync, the syncer will usually copy changes in one direction. For example, if you are syncing pods from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, when changes
are made to one of the pods in the host cluster, those fields are overwritten when the sync occurs. There are a couple of fields that are exceptions that are supported due to bi-directional sync. 
:::

If the resource is being asked to sync from the host cluster to the virtual cluster, as soon as that resource is created in the host cluster, vCluster copies it to the virtual cluster. 
Any changes to the resource in the host cluster are automatically applied to the resource in the virtual cluster.

When syncing resources, vCluster stores the mapping of the `VIRTUAL NAME <-> HOST NAME` for the actual resource, and the references of the other resources used by this resource. 
Tracking references helps the vCluster to understand what resources are still needed in the host cluster. This important for secrets and configmaps because by default only the secrets and configmaps used by pods are actually synced to the host cluster.

Assume you've started your vCluster with ingress syncing to the host enabled. The `sync` field will automatically deploy syncer to sync resources between virtual cluster and the host cluster.

``` vcluster.yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```

After the virtual cluster is up, the user creates an ingress in the virtual cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
      - https-example.foo.com
    secretName: testsecret-tls
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
        backend:
          service:
            name: nginx
            port:
              number: 80
```

When vCluster copies the ingress to the host cluster, the vCluster creates an ingress in the namespace of the virtual cluster with the following changes:

* **Name Rewritten**: vCluster rewrites the name of the resource to avoid conflicts in the host cluster. The name is rewritten in the form of `NAME-x-NAMESPACE-x-VCLUSTER_NAME`
* **Namespace Rewritten**: vCluster rewrites the namespace of the resource to sync everything into the namespace of the deployed virtual cluster control plane.
* **Annotations / Labels Added**: vCluster adds annotations and labels to identify the resource in the host cluster, which are pre-fixed with `vcluster.loft.sh/`.
* **References Rewritten**: vCluster rewrites the `spec.rules[*].http.paths[*].backend.service.name` and `spec.tls[*].secretName` to match the rewritten names of the resources in the host cluster.


```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-host-name: nginx-x-default-x-vcluster
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-host-namespace: vcluster
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-kind: networking.k8s.io/v1, Kind=Ingress
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-name: nginx
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-namespace: default
    vcluster.loft.sh/object-uid: bb8bea39-8c0c-4295-8616-6a20b3b1900a
  labels:
    vcluster.loft.sh/managed-by: vcluster
    vcluster.loft.sh/namespace: default
  name: nginx-x-default-x-vcluster
  namespace: vcluster
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: nginx-x-default-x-vcluster
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - https-example.foo.com
    secretName: testsecret-tls-x-default-x-vcluster
```

### Syncing labels to the host cluster

When syncing labels to the host cluster, vCluster rewrites the following labels to avoid conflicts:

* `release` - This label must be rewritten when pods are synced to the single namespace where the vCluster control plane pod is running, but 
not rewritten when the pod is synced in a namespace that is synced from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. 
* `vcluster.loft.sh/namespace`
* `vcluster.loft.sh/managed-by`
* `vcluster.loft.sh/controlled-by`
