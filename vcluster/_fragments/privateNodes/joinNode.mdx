*Pre-requisites*

- vCluster CLI installed on your local machine
- vCluster control plane has to be running and in `Ready` state
- A node that satisfies the [node requirements](./node-requirements)

To join worker nodes, a token from the vCluster must be created to provide access and permissions. A single token
can be used for any node(s) to join, or if you wanted to, you could create a token for each node.

By default, the token expires within 1 hour. The token is stored as a secret prefixed with `bootstrap-token-` in the `kube-system` namespace.
The expiry timestamp is stored under the `expiration` key in the secret.

```bash title="Create a token for worker nodes"
export VCLUSTER_NAME=my-vcluster

# Connect to your vcluster
vcluster connect $VCLUSTER_NAME

# Create a token
vcluster token create --expires=1h
```
