vCluster Standalone is a different architecture model for vCluster for the control plane and node as there is no requirement
of a host cluster. vCluster is deployed directly onto nodes like other Kubernetes distribution. vCluster Standalone can
 run on any type of node, whether that is a bare-metal node or VM. It provides the strictest isolation for workloads as there is no shared host cluster for the control plane or worker nodes.
 
When enabling vCluster Standalone, the control plane is now no longer on a shared host cluster, but on its own independent node. Worker
nodes must be private nodes.

## Installation Overview

vCluster Standalone requires having dedicated nodes to build your control plane nodes and optionally add additional worker nodes. 

The steps are to bring up a vCluster Standalone cluster are:

1. Install an initial control plane node. 
2. (Optional) Join additional control plane nodes. 
3. (Optional) Join worker nodes.
