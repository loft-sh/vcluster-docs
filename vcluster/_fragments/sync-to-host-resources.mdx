vCluster can sync certain resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster and back. These resources are typically created within the virtual cluster and are expected to be changeable within the virtual cluster. These are typically namespace-scoped resources (although exceptions exist) such as Pods, Secrets, ConfigMaps, Services etc.

vCluster also allows to sync custom resources via the [custom resources syncer](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/advanced/custom-resources.mdx)
