vCluster is able to use different Kubernetes distributions as a virtual cluster backend. By default, vCluster will use vanilla k8s as the virtual Kubernetes cluster.

:::warning
Changing the distro of vCluster is not supported once deployed
:::

## Vanilla k8s

In order to use vanilla k8s as a backing cluster, create a vCluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster
```

Connect to the vCluster and start using it:

```
kubectl get ns
...
```

For more configuration options, please take a look at the [k8s distro reference](/docs/vcluster/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/distro/k8s)

## k3s

[k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.

In order to use k3s as backing cluster, create a vCluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --set controlPlane.distro.k3s.enabled=true
```

Start using it:

```
kubectl get ns
...
```

For more configuration options, please take a look at the [k8s distro reference](/docs/vcluster/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/distro/k3s)

## k0s

[k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s) is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. vCluster supports k0s as backing virtual Kubernetes cluster.

In order to use k0s as backing cluster, create a vCluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --set controlPlane.distro.k0s.enabled=true
```

Start using it:

```
kubectl get ns
...
```

Please note that dual stack networking is not supported with k0s, you will be able to deploy it on a dual stack host cluster, but it will not have all the dual stack features.

For more configuration options, please take a look at the [k8s distro reference](/docs/vcluster/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/distro/k0s)
