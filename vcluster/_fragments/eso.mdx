- `kubectl` installed
- `external-secrets` operator installed on your host cluster. See instructions at https://external-secrets.io/latest/

# External secrets integration

:::warning Configuration Changes
The sync configuration for this integration has been updated.

Configuration for each resource type is now defined under the relevant `toHost` or `fromHost` section.  
For more information, see the [configuration reference](#config-reference).

Label selectors are now supported for all resources and follow the format used by the upstream Kubernetes API.

Previous configuration keys are deprecated starting in version 0.27.0.
:::

To enable the external secret integration, set the following fields:

```yaml
integrations:
  externalSecrets:
    enabled: true
    sync:
      toHost:
        stores:
          enabled: true
      fromHost:
        clusterStores:
          enabled: true
```

This enables the integration and the sync for all CRDs:
- `ExternalSecret`: namespaced, synced from virtual cluster into host cluster and then bi-directionally
- `SecretStore`: namespaced, synced from virtual cluster into host cluster
- `ClusterSecretStore`: cluster scoped, synced from host cluster into virtual cluster

Once the virtual cluster is up and running, you can create a `SecretStore` inside the virtual cluster.
For this guide, you use the `fake` store type, which prefills data instead of connecting to a distant secret store.

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: fake
spec:
  provider:
    fake:
      data:
      - key: "/foo/bar"
        value: "HELLO1"
        version: "v1"
      - key: "/foo/bar"
        value: "HELLO2"
        version: "v2"
      - key: "/foo/baz"
        value: '{"john": "doe"}'
        version: "v1"
```

Inside the virtual cluster, create the store with `kubectl apply -f fake.yaml`.
This creates a corresponding store in the host cluster.
You can then create an `ExternalSecret` in the virtual cluster, which references the `SecretStore`.

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    name: fake
    kind: SecretStore
  target:
    name: secret-to-be-created
  data:
  - secretKey: foo_bar
    remoteRef:
      key: /foo/bar
      version: v1
  dataFrom:
  - extract:
      key: /foo/baz
      version: v1
```

After the `ExternalSecret` is created in the virtual cluster, the integration creates a corresponding resource inside the host cluster.
The external secret operator running in the host creates the corresponding Kubernetes secret which the integration imports into the virtual cluster.
Running `kubectl get secrets` in the virtual cluster includes the `secret-to-be-created` in its output.
