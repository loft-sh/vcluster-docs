You can modify the sync behaviour with translate patches that target specific paths. Currently there is 2 different kinds of patches supported.

:::info Wildcard patches
You can use `*` in paths to select all entries of an array or object, e.g. `spec.containers[*].name` or `spec.containers[*].volumeMounts[*]`. vCluster will then just call the patch multiple times.

### JavaScript Expressions

These are powerful JavaScript ES6 compatible expressions to change a field while syncing. You can define how it should changed when syncing from the vCluster into the host cluster or when syncing from the host cluster into the virtual cluster. To change the path <span>{props.path}</span> you can do:
<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`sync:
  toHost:
    ${props.resource}:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: ${props.path}
        expression: '"my-prefix-"+value'
        # optional reverseExpression to reverse the change from the host cluster
        # reverseExpression: 'value.slice("my-prefix".length)'`}
</CodeBlock>

There is also a variable called `context` besides `value` that can be used to access vCluster specific data:
* `context.vcluster.name`: Name of the vCluster
* `context.vcluster.namespace`: Namespace of the vCluster
* `context.vcluster.config`: Config of the vCluster, basically `vcluster.yaml` merged with the defaults
* `context.hostObject`: Host object (can be null if not available)
* `context.virtualObject`: Virtual object (can be null if not available)
* `context.path`: The matched path on the object, useful when using wildcard path selectors (*)

### Reference patches

Tell vCluster that this specific field points to a different resource that should get rewritten. vCluster will also automatically import the referenced resource if it can find it in the host cluster. For example:
<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`sync:
  toHost:
    ${props.resource}:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: metadata.annotations["my-secret-ref"]
        reference:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Secret`}
</CodeBlock>

This will tell vCluster to translate the path `metadata.annotations["my-secret-ref"]` as it points to a secret. If the secret is created in the host cluster, vCluster will automatically import it.

:::info Multi-Namespace-Mode
With multi-namespace-mode you only need to rewrite references that include a namespace. You can use the `namespacePath` option to specify the path of the namespace of the reference.
