## Create a vCluster with private nodes

### Create the vCluster control plane with private nodes enabled

The vCluster control plane needs to be created with private nodes feature enabled. 

:::warning Private Nodes must be enabled at the start
Private nodes need to be enabled from the initial installation of the vCluster. An existing 
vCluster cannot upgrade from using the host cluster's nodes to private nodes. 
:::

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml for private nodes"
# Enable private nodes
privateNodes:
  enabled: true

# vCluster control plane options
controlPlane:
  distro:
    k8s:
      image:
        tag: v1.31.2 # Kubernetes version you want to use
  service:
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer # If you want to expose vCluster via LoadBalancer (recommended option)

# Networking configuration
networking:
  # Specify the pod cidr
  podCIDR: 10.64.0.0/16
  # Specify the service cidr
  serviceCIDR: 10.128.0.0/16
```

:::info Connecting to the platform
Follow [this guide](/docs/vcluster/next/configure/vcluster-yaml/platform) to create an access key and set up the vCluster for deployment using Helm or other tools.
:::

### Join worker nodes

Ensure your [nodes are ready to join](./node-requirements) the vCluster, before [joining each worker node](./join).

Once a worker node has been attached to a vCluster, pods can be scheduled and start to run on these nodes. 

### Manage vCluster

Finally, after vCluster is up and running, [manage](./manage) the lifecycle of the vCluster and worker nodes.
