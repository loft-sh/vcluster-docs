Joining air-gapped nodes is supported, but there are a few additional steps needed.

1. Make sure virtual cluster control plane is reachable from the node.

2. Download a list of required docker images
This is shipped as release asset named `vcluster-private-nodes-images-k8s-[KUBERNETES-VERSION].txt.txt` file in each vCluster release.
Download it from the [vCluster release page](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases) for your vCluster / k8s version.
Copy this file to the node.
Save the path to the file in env var as
```bash title="Save path to the images.txt"
export PRELOAD_IMAGES_TXT_PATH=<path>
```

3. Determine your virtual cluster version and node architecture
Run `kubectl version` in the virtual cluster context and save the Server Version (e.g. `v1.32.2`)
Then, determine your node architecture by running `uname -p` on the node.

4. Download kubernetes private node components bundle
Find a version matching your Server version in https://github.com/loft-sh/kubernetes/releases
Download archive named `kubernetes-[your-k8s-version]-[your-node-arch].tar.gz` (it is a kubernetes private node components bundle).

5. Copy downloaded kubernetes private node components bundle to the node
And save the full path to the bundle in the env var:
```bash title="Save path to the bundle"
export KUBE_COMPONENTS_BUNDLE_PATH=<path>
```

<PrivateNodesJoin />

The output provides a command to run on your worker node:

```bash title="Example output from creating a token"
curl -sfLk https://<vcluster-endpoint>/node/join?token=<token> | sh -
```

you need to save the script locally, as we will pass additional flags:

```bash title="Save join script"
curl -fSLk https://<vcluster-endpoint>/node/join?token=<token> > join_script.sh
chmod +x join_script.sh
```

then, execute script and pass path to a bundle:

```bash title="Join script"
./join_script.sh --bundle-path ${KUBE_COMPONENTS_BUNDLE_PATH}
```

6. Pull required docker images to the node
```bash title="Pull required images to the node containerd"
while IFS= read -r image; do
    [[ -z "$image" ]] && continue
    /usr/local/bin/crictl pull "$image"
done < ${PRELOAD_IMAGES_TXT_PATH}
```

After a while, node should report as `Ready` in the `kubectl get nodes`.
