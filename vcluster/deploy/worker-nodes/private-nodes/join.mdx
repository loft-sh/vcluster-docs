## Prerequisites

- vCluster CLI installed on your local machine
- vCluster control plane has to be running and in `Ready` state
- A node that satisfies the [node requirements](./node-requirements)

## Create token

To join worker nodes, a token from the vCluster must be created to provide access and permissions. A single token
can be used for any node(s) to join, or if you wanted to, you could create a token for each node.

By default, the token expires within 1 hour. The token is stored as a secret prefixed with `bootstrap-token-` in the `kube-system` namespace.
The expiry timestamp is stored under the `expiration` key in the secret.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="as-container"
  values={[
    { label: 'Control-Plane As Container', value: 'as-container',},
    { label: 'Control-Plane As Binary', value: 'as-binary',}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="as-binary">
    Make sure your kube context is set to vCluster Standalone cluster.
    ```bash title="Create a token for worker nodes"
    # Create a token
    vcluster token create --expires=1h
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="as-container">
    ```bash title="Create a token for worker nodes"
    export VCLUSTER_NAME=my-vcluster

    # Connect to your vcluster
    vcluster connect $VCLUSTER_NAME

    # Create a token
    vcluster token create --expires=1h
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The output provides a command to run on your worker node:

```bash title="Example output from creating a token"
curl -sfLk https://<vcluster-endpoint>/node/join?token=<token> | sh -
```

## Join each worker node

For each worker node that you want to join vCluster, run the command on the node.

```bash title="Example output on worker node"

This node has joined the cluster:
* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and a response was received.
* The kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the control-plane to see this node join the cluster.
```

## Available flags to use in the script to join nodes

The output of creating the token outputs a script to join the worker node to the vCluster. There are several flags available that can be added to the script.

| Flag | Description | Default |
| ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `--kubernetes-version` | Version of kubernetes node components | optional, defaults to the version of vCluster k8s |
| `--repository-url` | Specific vCluster version to install | optional, defaults to `/usr/local/bin` |
| `--binaries-dir` | allows to customize target directory where k8s node components binaries are installed | optional, defaults to `/usr/local/bin |
| `--cni-binaries-dir` | allows to customize target directory where CNI binaries are installed | optional, defaults to `/opt/cni/bin` |
| `--skip-reset` | Skips uninstalling existing node components | optional, default to false (reset happens before install by default) |
| `--bundle-path` | If set, skips downloading Kubernetes binaries and uses a local path. Expects a path to bundle in `.tar.gz` format | optional, empty by default |
| `--reset-only` | only uninstall previously installed node components. Use this to cleanup the node | optional, defaults to `false` |
| `--skip-join` | Installs all required components but skips joining node to the cluster. This can be useful if you want to update the kubeadm join config before joining the node to the cluster manually by executing `kubeadm join` | optional, defaults to `false` |
| `--node-name` | Node name in the kubernetes cluster | optional, defaults to hostname |
| `--force-join` | Force joining even when there is existing kubelet service running on the node.  | optional, defaults to `false` |

These flags can be passed to the script by appending `--` and then the flag:

```bash title="Run join script with flags"
curl -sfLk https://<vcluster-endpoint>/node/join?token=<token> | sh -s -- --force-join
```
