When creating a virtual cluster, the default set of worker nodes comes from the host cluster that the vCluster is deployed on. 

If you select using nodes from the host cluster, you cannot change the worker node pool after the vCluster is deployed. 

## Shared nodes

By default, vCluster can access **all** the nodes in the host cluster. The virtual cluster can either view the nodes as pseudo nodes or view the real nodes due to node syncing. 

### Pseudo nodes

### Real nodes (Synced from the host cluster) 


## Dedicated nodes
