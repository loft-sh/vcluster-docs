When creating a virtual cluster, the default set of worker nodes comes from the host cluster that the vCluster is deployed on. 

If you select using nodes from the host cluster, you cannot change the worker node pool after the vCluster is deployed. 

## Set of nodes to deploy workloads to

### All shared nodes

By default, vCluster can access **all** the nodes in the host cluster. The virtual cluster can either view the nodes as pseudo nodes or view the real nodes due to node syncing. 

### Dedicated nodes


## How nodes are displayed in the vCluster

### Pseudo nodes

By default, nodes are not synced from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. They only show up as nodes in the virtual cluster
when there are pods running on them. 

Pseudo nodes only have real values for the CPU, architecture, and operating system, while everything else is randomly generated. A single pseudo node can either represent a single real node on the host cluster, or it can represent multiple real nodes. If there are no more pods on a node, vCluster deletes the pseudo node.

### Real nodes (Synced from the host cluster)
