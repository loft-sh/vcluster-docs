vCluster offers several different policies to automatically isolate workloads in a virtual
cluster. For all options within each policy, review the [policies documentation](../../../../configure/vcluster-yaml/policies/).

In order to isolate workloads on a vCluster, you need to enable a couple of configuration options: 

1. Set a [Pod Security Standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/). If you enable either `baseline` or `restricted` policy, it follows the standards outlined in Kubernetes. 
For example, with `baseline` as a Pod Security Standard,
pods that try to run as a privileged
container or mount a host path are not synced to the host cluster. Though Pod Security Standard is a Kubernetes concept and only applicable
to certain versions of Kubernetes, vCluster supports this regardless of Kubernetes version as this is directly implemented in vCluster. Rejected 
pods stay `Pending` in the vCluster and in newer Kubernetes version they are denied by the admission controller.
as well.
2. Enable a [resource quota](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
as well as a [limit range](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/). This allows restricting resource consumption of
vCluster workloads. If enabled, sane defaults for those 2 resources are chosen.
3. Enable a [network policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
that restricts access of vCluster workloads as well as the
vCluster control plane to other pods in the host cluster. This only works if your host
[cluster CNI supports network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#prerequisites).


```yaml title="Example of Workload Isolation YAML"
policies:
  # empty, baseline, restricted can be used here
  podSecurityStandard: baseline

  resourceQuota:
    enabled: true

  limitRange:
    enabled: true

  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
```

:::info
When enabling resource quotas locally, add a `--expose-local=false`
flag to your `vcluster create [...]` command, as by default the vCluster CLI
tries to automatically expose the vCluster using NodePorts, when interacting
with a local Kubernetes cluster.

## Network only isolation

By default, workloads created by vCluster are able to communicate with other workloads in
the host cluster through their cluster IPs. This can be beneficial if
you want to purposely access a host cluster service, which is a good method to
share services between virtual clusters. 

If you do not want pods running inside one vCluster to have access to other workloads
in the host cluster, then deploy a [network policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
for the specific namespace where vCluster is installed in.

vCluster can automatically deploy this network policy in your host cluster.

```yaml title="Example of enabling network policy"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
```

:::warning
Network policies do not work in all Kubernetes clusters and need to be supported
by the underlying CNI plugin.

## Advanced Isolation

Besides the basic workload isolation using Pod Security Standard and Resource Quotas, you could always set more advanced
isolation methods.

### Isolation with dedicated nodes

Pods created in the vCluster set their
[tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/),
which affect scheduling decisions on the shared host cluster. To prevent the pods from being scheduled
to the undesirable nodes, you can use the `sync.fromHost.nodes.selector.labels` to select specific nodes from the host cluster.
 
 ### Isolation with private nodes

Instead of using nodes from the shared host cluster, you can use [private nodes](../../../worker-nodes/private-nodes) for the virtual cluster. 

## Workload & Network Isolation within the vCluster

Besides isolating workloads from one virtual cluster to another virtual cluster, normal workload isolation
from within the vCluster can also be achieved by deploying resource quotas, limit ranges, admission controllers
and network policies in the virtual cluster. To allow network policies to function correctly,
you'll need to enable the same configuration options in the deployment of the virtual cluster through the `vcluster.yaml`.

### Secret based Service Account tokens

By default, vCluster creates a service account token for each pod and injects
them as an annotation in the respective pod's metadata. If this doesn't comply
with your security practices, this can be mitigated by enabling an option
in the `vcluster.yaml` which creates separate secrets for each pod's
service account token and mounts it accordingly using projected volumes. 

```yaml 
sync:
  toHost:
    pods:
      useSecretsForSATokens: true
```
