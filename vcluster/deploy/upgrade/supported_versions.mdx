The following defines vCluster's lifecycle policy for releases and maintenance.

vCluster aims to release on a regular cadence and follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We encourage users to run the latest stable release
to stay up to date on features and security patches.

Due to the rapid development of vCluster, each minor version is actively supported for 3 months after it's been released. At the end of
active support, it moves to into maintenance support for 3 months. During active support, any updates on the active development branch can 
be backported upon request. During maintenance support, backporting is limited only to security updates.

Any previous versions which are not on this list are no longer in any support window.

## vCluster supported versions

| Release | Released | Active Support End Date | Maintenance Support End Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.22 | December 18, 2024 | March 18, 2025 | June 18, 2025 |
| v0.21 | November 11, 2024 | February 11, 2025 | May 11, 2025 |
| v0.20 | August 14, 2024 | November 14, 2024 | February 14, 2025 |
| v0.19 | February 12, 2024 | April 1, 2025* | July 1, 2025 |

\* Due to the number of breaking changes from v0.19 to v0.20, v0.19 has an extended active support end date. Review the [migration guide](../../reference/migrations/0-20-migration.mdx) to upgrade your v0.19 to v0.20 virtual clusters.


## Kubernetes compatibility matrix

The following matrix shows the compatibility between host and virtual clusters when both are using vanilla Kubernetes. It indicates which versions of vanilla Kubernetes on the host cluster support which versions of vanilla Kubernetes on the virtual cluster.


| Host K8s â†“ / vCluster k8s â†’ | v1.31 | v1.30 | v1.29 | v1.28 |
|-----------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **v1.31**                   | âœ…    | ðŸ†—     | ðŸ†—    | ðŸ†—    |
