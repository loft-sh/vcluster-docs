The following defines vCluster's lifecycle policy for releases and maintenance.

vCluster aims to release on a regular cadence and follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We encourage users to run the latest stable release
to stay up to date on features and security patches.

Due to the rapid development of vCluster, each minor version is actively supported for 3 months after it's been released. At the end of
active support, it moves to into maintenance support for 3 months. During active support, any updates on the active development branch can
be backported upon request. During maintenance support, backporting is limited only to security updates.

Any previous versions which are not on this list are no longer in any support window.

<SupportedVersions />

## Kubernetes compatibility matrix

The following matrix shows the compatibility between host and virtual clusters when both are using vanilla Kubernetes. It indicates which versions of vanilla Kubernetes on the host cluster support which versions of vanilla Kubernetes on the virtual cluster. When new Kubernetes versions are released, conformance tests are aimed to be run on the latest vCluster version within 30 days. Kubernetes versions that are no longer supported upstream can still be used, but without any guarantees.
