The following defines vCluster's lifecycle policy for releases and maintenance.

vCluster follows a regular release cadence and adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We recommend that users run the latest stable release to stay up to date with new features and security patches.  

<SupportedVersions />

## Kubernetes compatibility matrix

The matrix below shows compatibility between host and virtual clusters running vanilla Kubernetes. It specifies which versions of vanilla Kubernetes on the host cluster support which versions on the virtual cluster.  

When a new Kubernetes version is released, conformance tests are conducted on the latest vCluster version within 30 days.  

Kubernetes versions that are no longer supported upstream can still be used but are not guaranteed to work.
