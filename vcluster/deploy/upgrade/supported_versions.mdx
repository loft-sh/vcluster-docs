Due to the rapid development of vCluster, each minor version of vCluster is actively supported for 3 months after it's been released. At the end of
active support, it moves to into maintenance support for 3 months, where only security fixes are fixed in that version. Any previous versions that are not on this list are no longer in any support window.
