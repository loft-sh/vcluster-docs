The following defines vCluster's lifecycle policy for releases and maintenance.

vCluster follows a regular release cadence and adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We recommend that users run the latest stable release to stay up to date with new features and security patches.  

Due to the rapid development of the platform, each minor version receives active support for 3 months after its release. This period is referred to as End of Support (EOS). After EOS, the version enters a maintenance phase with limited support. During active support, updates from the active development branch can be backported upon request. Following active support, the version enters a maintenance phase known as End of Life (EOL), in which only critical security updates are backported.

Any versions not listed under EOS or EOL are no longer supported.

## Kubernetes compatibility matrix

The matrix below shows compatibility between host and virtual clusters running vanilla Kubernetes. It specifies which versions of vanilla Kubernetes on the host cluster support which versions on the virtual cluster.  

When a new Kubernetes version is released, conformance tests are conducted on the latest vCluster version within 30 days.  

Kubernetes versions that are no longer supported upstream can still be used but are not guaranteed to work.
