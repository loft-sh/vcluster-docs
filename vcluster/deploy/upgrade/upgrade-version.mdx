import UpgradeVersion from '../../_partials/manage/upgrade-version.mdx'

At any time, you can upgrade the version of your vCluster. During the upgrade, you can also apply
configuration option changes.

<p></p>

<!-- vale off -->
If you are moving from vCluster 0.19.x to 0.20+, see the [conversion guide](/vcluster/reference/migrations/0-20-migration) for how to automatically convert your existing `values.yaml` configuration file to the new `vcluster.yaml` format.

## Update `vcluster.yaml`

Optionally, you can update your `vcluster.yaml` to change your configuration options during a vCluster version upgrade.

<p></p>
:::warning Limitations on changing configuration
You cannot change distros or backing store once a virtual cluster is deployed, with one exception: starting with vCluster 0.25.0, migration from K3s to K8s distro is supported. For more details, see the [K3s to K8s Migration](./distro-migration.mdx).

## Upgrade vCluster version

These steps assume that you have been a `vcluster.yaml`, but there are variables in the code blocks for you to replace for:

- Name of the virtual cluster
- Namespace of where the virtual cluster is deployed
- Version to upgrade to

<UpgradeVersion />
