vCluster creates isolated Kubernetes environments by deploying a virtual cluster that contains its own dedicated virtual control plane. This
control plane orchestrates operations within the virtual cluster and facilitates interaction with the underlying host cluster. The virtual
control plane is deployed as a single pod managed as a StatefulSet (default) or Deployment. By default, any workloads from a virtual
cluster are deployed in the same namespace of a host cluster.

If you don't want to have your workloads running in the same namespace of the same host cluster, you can enable our isolated control plane feature,
which allows you to run a vCluster control plane pod in one host cluster while a separate, headless vCluster runs workloads in another cluster. A headless vcluster
is a vCluster without a control plane pod.

Separation of management and workload execution is often critical for security, management, or operational reasons.

<p></p>

:::note Name of the Virtual Clusters
The release names in both clusters **must be the same** to ensure that the vCluster can properly sync across them. In this example, they are both called `my-vcluster`.
:::

## Part 1:  Set up the Headless vCluster

### Create a Headless vCluster

On the host cluster that will run the workloads, create a Headless vCluster with the following `vcluster.yaml`.

```yaml
experimental:
  isolatedControlPlane:
    headless: true
```

<Deploy />


### Obtain the kubeconfig of the Headless vCluster

On the host cluster, you must obtain the kubeconfig of the Headless vCluster. This will be used to allow the control plane vCluster to communicate with it.

```bash
export WORKLOAD_KUBECONFIG=$(kubectl config view --raw -o json | TOKEN=$(kubectl create token vc-my-vcluster \
  -n team-x \
  --duration=48h \
) jq '."current-context" as $current | (.contexts[] | select(.name == $current)) as $context | {
  "current-context": ."current-context",
  "kind": ."kind",
  "apiVersion": ."apiVersion",
  "contexts": [$context],
  "clusters": [.clusters[] | select(.name == $context.context.cluster) | del(.cluster."certificate-authority-data") | .cluster."insecure-skip-tls-verify" = true],
  "users": [.users[] | select(.name == $context.context.user) | del(.user."client-certificate-data") | del(.user."client-key-data") | .user.token = $ENV.TOKEN]
}' | yq -P)
```

:::warning Kube Context
Confirm that your kube context is set to the host cluster and not the newly created Headless vCluster. If you used the vCluster CLI, use `vcluster disconnect` to be
set back to your previous kube context.
:::

## Part 2: Set Up the Control Plane vCluster

### Switch to the kube context of the other Host

Now, switch to the kube context of the host where the control plane will be deployed:

```bash
kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME
```

### Create the Namespace for the Control Plane

Create a namespace in your cluster that will host the control plane vCluster:

```bash
kubectl create namespace vc-control-plane
```

### Configure Kubeconfig Secret

Using the kubeconfig obtained from the headless vCluster setup, create a Kubernetes secret in the control plane namespace.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic vc-remote-workloads-kubeconfig \
  --namespace vc-control-plane \
  --from-literal=kubeconfig=$WORKLOAD_KUBECONFIG
```

### Optional: Configure Platform Kubeconfig Secret

If you won't activate your vCluster through other means, you can manually activate it to ensure it is fully operational. This step is essential if you're setting up the vCluster for the first time or have yet to be automatically activated during deployment (by e.g. the CLI or platform section). Perform this step in the Kubernetes context of your control plane cluster:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic vcluster-platform-api-key \
  --namespace vc-control-plane \
  --from-literal=accessKey=$ACCESS_KEY \
  --from-literal=host=$PLATFORM_HOST
```

:::info
You can also specify the project via `project` key, if the platform is insecure via `insecure` and the virtual cluster name in the platform via `name`.
:::

This command activates the `my-vcluster` vCluster in the `vc-control-plane` namespace.

### Create the Control Plane vCluster

Set up the control plane vCluster using the following `vcluster.yaml`.

```yaml
experimental:
  isolatedControlPlane:
    enabled: true
    namespace: "team-x"
    service: "my-vcluster"
    kubeConfig: "/worker-cluster/kubeconfig.yaml"

controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    persistence:
      addVolumes:
        - name: workload-kubeconfig
          secret:
            secretName: vc-remote-workloads-kubeconfig
            items:
              - key: kubeconfig
                path: kubeconfig.yaml
      addVolumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /worker-cluster
          name: workload-kubeconfig
          readOnly: true
  service:
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer

networking:
  advanced:
    proxyKubelets:
      byHostname: false
      byIP: false
```

<details>
<summary>
Setting up the control plane without Load Balancer support
</summary>

By default vCluster starts a `LoadBalancer` type Service to serve API. In some environments like local development clusters or bare metal clusters you might want to use `NodePort` type instead. In order to do this, include this configuration in your `vcluster.yaml` file.

```yaml
controlPlane:
  service:
    spec:
      type: NodePort
    httpsNodePort: 30999
```
</details>

On the host cluster that will run the control, create a control plane vCluster.

<Deploy />

## Testing out the Isolated Control Plane

In the kube context of the control plane vCluster, try deploying an application and see
that the pods only run in the host cluster of the headless vCluster and not in the control plane vCluster.
