The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) to ensure the security and
interoperability of computer systems used by the U.S. government.

FIPS 140-2 is a U.S. Federal Government security standard used to approve
cryptographic modules. This document explains how vCluster Pro and all its components
are built with FIPS-validated cryptographic libraries.

## Use of FIPS compatible Go toolchain

vCluster Pro is written in [Go](https://go.dev/), and the FIPS-compliant builds
are compiled using the `GOEXPERIMENT=boringcrypto` environment variable.

This directs the Go compiler to replace the standard Go crypto libraries with the
[FIPS-validated BoringCrypto](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4407)
module by Google.
See GoBoring's [readme](https://go.dev/src/crypto/internal/boring/README) for
more details.
NIST validates [Google's BoringCrypto](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/master/crypto/fipsmodule/FIPS.md)
modules on a wide range of systems.

### FIPS Support in vCluster Components

Most of the components used in vCluster are statically compiled with the
boringcrypto Go compiler. vCluster, from a components perspective, contains
multiple sub-components it depends on.

The list below contains components built in a FIPS-compliant manner:

- [Kubernetes API Server](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/kubernetes-fips)
- [Kubernetes Controller Manager](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/kubernetes-fips)
- [Kubernetes Scheduler](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/kubernetes-fips)
- [Kine](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/kine-fips)
- [ETCD](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/etcd-fips)

:::caution
vCluster Pro currently does not provide FIPS-compliant builds of
CoreDNS or Helm. One will have to use the integrated CoreDNS feature
of vCluster Pro.

### FIPS vCluster Pro Images

The vCluster Pro FIPS-compliant images can be found in our [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-pro/pkgs/container/vcluster-pro-fips).

## Running vCluster FIPS-compliant

To run vCluster in a FIPS environment, one will have to reconfigure the
repositories used to reference the FIPS images and enable CoreDNS.

The following is an example of a `vcluster.yaml` file that one can use to create
a FIPS-compliant vCluster Pro instance.

```yaml
controlPlane:
  advanced:
    defaultImageRegistry: ghcr.io
    # uncomment to use virtual scheduler within vCluster
    # virtualScheduler:
    #   enabled: true
  statefulSet:
    image:
      repository: loft-sh/vcluster-pro-fips
  distro:
    k8s:
      apiServer:
        image:
          repository: loft-sh/kubernetes-fips
      controllerManager:
        image:
          repository: loft-sh/kubernetes-fips
      # uncomment to use FIPS compliant virtual scheduler within vCluster
      # scheduler:
      #   image:
      #     repository: loft-sh/kubernetes-fips
  coredns:
    embedded: true
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      embedded:
        enabled: true # The use of embedded etcd is recommended, yet optional
# uncomment to use virtual scheduler within vCluster
# sync:
#   fromHost:
#     nodes:
#       enabled: true
```

And run:

```bash
vcluster create my-fips-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml
```
