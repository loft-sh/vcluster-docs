There are multiple ways to deploy and manage your vCluster. Review the different choices and choose the one that suits your needs.

<!-- vale off -->

## Predeployment configuration options

Before deploying, it's recommended to review the set of configuration options that cannot be updated post deployment. These options require deploying a new vCluster instead of upgrading your vCluster with new options.

### Topologies

- **[High availability](./topologies/high-availability)** - Run multiple copies of vCluster components.
- **[Isolated workloads](./topologies/isolated-workloads)** - Different options to isolate a workload in a vCluster.
- **[Isolated control plane](./topologies/isolated-control-plane)** - Run vCluster control plane in a host cluster different from the host cluster running workloads.
- **[Rootless mode](./security/rootless-mode)** - Deploy the vCluster pod without root access to the host cluster.


### Other options

<details>
    <summary>Backing store options</summary>


vCluster supports etcd or a relational database (using KINE) as the backend.This feature provides flexibility to vCluster operators. The available data store options allow you to select a data store that fits your use case.

vCluster supports the following datastore options:

- [Embedded SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (default with `PersistentVolume` (PV))
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
- [etcd](https://etcd.io/)

<p></p>
:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, there are limited migration paths to change your backing store. Review the backing store migration options before deploying.

### Configuration options

<Tabs
    defaultValue="embedded-sqlite-default"
    values={[
        { label: 'Embedded SQLite (Default)', value: 'embedded-sqlite-default', },
        { label: 'Embedded SQLite (No PV)', value: 'embedded-sqlite-nopv', },
        { label: 'Embedded etcd', value: 'embedded-etcd', },
        { label: 'Deployed etcd', value: 'deployed-etcd', },
        { label: 'MySQL / MariaDB', value: 'mysql', },
        { label: 'PostgreSQL', value: 'postgresql', },
    ]}>
<TabItem value="embedded-sqlite-default">

This is the default, so you don't need to configure anything. If you want to explicitly set this option, you can use:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      embedded:
        enabled: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="embedded-sqlite-nopv">

By default, vCluster stores its data in a `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC).
Alternatively, you can use an [`emptyDir`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) volume to store virtual cluster data.

To use an `emptyDir` to store the data instead of a `PersistentVolume`, create a `values.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    persistence:
      volumeClaim:
        enabled: true
```

Then upgrade or recreate the vCluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

:::warning Potential data loss
This method should only be used for testing purposes, as data is lost upon pod recreation.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="embedded-etcd">

This is an enterprise feature that allows you to deploy etcd within each vCluster to enable high availability (HA), which isn’t supported with embedded SQLite:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      embedded:
        enabled: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="deployed-etcd">

This deploys an etcd instance outside of the vCluster control plane pod that is used as a backing store:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

The option for MySQL and MariaDB typically has the following format:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      external:
        enabled: true
        dataSource: mysql://username:password@tcp(hostname:3306)/database-name
```

If you specify a database name and it does not exist, the server attempts to create it.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="postgresql">

The option for PostgreSQL typically has the following format:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      external:
        enabled: true
        dataSource: postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database-name
```

More advanced configuration parameters are available. For more information, see https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq.

If you specify a database name and it does not exist, the server attempts to create it.

## Prerequisites

<PreRequisites />

## Deploy vCluster

All of the deployment options below have the following assumptions:

- A `vcluster.yaml` is provided. Refer to the `vcluster.yaml` [reference docs](../../configure/vcluster-yaml/README.mdx) to explore all configuration options. This file is optional and can be removed from the examples.
- The vCluster is called `my-vcluster`.
- The vCluster is be deployed into the `team-x` namespace.

:::tip YAML configuration
If you're not sure which options to configure, you can update most settings later by upgrading your vCluster with an updated `vcluster.yaml`.
However, some settings—such as the backing store—can only be set during the initial deployment and cannot be changed during an upgrade.

<Deploy />

## Deploy vCluster with the vCluster Platform

Virtual clusters can be deployed as standalone virtual clusters on host clusters as described above, but there is also a vCluster Platform that is a UI to manage your virtual clusters, host clusters and other resources.

There are many [features](/platform/) that are included as part of the vCluster Platform besides having a central management platform for virtual clusters.

If you already have vCluster Platform, [learn how to deploy virtual
clusters in the platform](/platform/use-platform/virtual-clusters/create/create-no-template).
