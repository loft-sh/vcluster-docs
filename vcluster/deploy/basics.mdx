There are multiple ways to deploy and manage your vCluster. Review the different choices and choose the one that suits your needs. 

## Pre-Deployment Configuration Options

Before deploying, it's recommended to review the set of configuration options that cannot be updated post deployment. These options require deploying a brand new vCluster instead of upgrading your vCluster with new options. 

### Topologies

    * **[High Availability](./topologies/high-availability)** - Run multiple copies of vCluster components.
    * **[Isolated Workloads](./topologies/isolated-workloads)** - Different options to isolate a workload in a vCluster.
    * **[Isolated Control Plane](./topologies/isolated-control-plane)** - Run vCluster control plane in a host cluster different from the host cluster running workloads. 
    * **[Multi-Namespace Mode](./topologies/multi-namespace-mode)** - Run the workloads on the host cluster in a different namespace from the namespace running the vCluster pod.
    * **[Rootless Mode](./security/rootless-mode)** - Deploy the vCluster pod without root access to the host cluster.


### Other Options

<details>
    <summary>Backing Store Options</summary>


vCluster allows you to use either etcd or a relational database via KINE as a backend. This feature provides flexibility to vCluster operators. The available datastore options allow you to select a datastore that best fits your use case.

vCluster supports the following datastore options:
* [Embedded SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (default with Persistent Volume)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* [etcd](https://etcd.io/)

:::warning
Changing the backing store of vCluster is not supported once deployed except for migrating from SQLite to embedded etcd.

### Configuration Options

<Tabs
    defaultValue="embedded-sqlite-default"
    values={[
        { label: 'Embedded SQLite (Default)', value: 'embedded-sqlite-default', },
        { label: 'Embedded SQLite (No PV)', value: 'embedded-sqlite-nopv', },
        { label: 'Embedded Etcd', value: 'embedded-etcd', },
        { label: 'Deployed Etcd', value: 'deployed-etcd', },
        { label: 'MySQL / MariaDB', value: 'mysql', },
        { label: 'Postgresql', value: 'postgresql', },
    ]}>
<TabItem value="embedded-sqlite-default">

This is the default, so you don't need to configure anything. If you want to explicitly set this option, you can use:
```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      embedded:
        enabled: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="embedded-sqlite-nopv">

By default, vCluster uses a persistent volume claim to store the data in. You can also instead use an [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) to store the virtual cluster data.

In order to use an emptyDir to store the data instead of a persistent volume, please create a `values.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    persistence:
      volumeClaim:
        enabled: true
```

Then upgrade or recreate the vCluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

:::warning Potential Data Loss
This method should only be used for testing purposes, as data will be lost upon pod recreation.
:::
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="embedded-etcd">

This is a pro only feature, but allows you to deploy etcd within each vCluster that allows you to use HA (which embedded SQLite doesn't allow):
```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      embedded:
        enabled: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="deployed-etcd">

This will deploy an etcd instance alongside vCluster that is used as a backing store:
```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mysql">

In its most common form, the option for MySQL and MariaDB has the following format:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      external:
        enabled: true
        dataSource: mysql://username:password@tcp(hostname:3306)/database-name
```

If you specify a database name and it does not exist, the server will attempt to create it.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="postgresql">

In its most common form, the option for PostgreSQL has the following format:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      external:
        enabled: true
        dataSource: postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database-name
```

More advanced configuration parameters are available. For more information on these, please see https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq.

If you specify a database name and it does not exist, the server will attempt to create it.

## Pre-requisites

<PreRequisites />

## Deploy vCluster

All of the deployment options deploy a vCluster called `my-vcluster` into a namespace `team-x` using the vCluster Helm chart. Each example expects a `vcluster.yaml`, which is an optional configuration file. Refer to the `vcluster.yaml` [reference docs](../configure/vcluster-yaml/README.mdx) to explore all configuration options.

:::tip vcluster.yaml configuration
If you aren't sure what options you want to configure, you can always upgrade your vCluster after deployment with an updated `vcluster.yaml` to change your configuration. There are some configuration options (e.g. backing store) that can only be defined during deployment and not changed during upgrade.

### Deploy vCluster with the vCluster Platform

Virtual clusters can be deployed as standalone virtual clusters on host clusters as described above, but there is also a vCluster Platform that is a UI to manage your virtual clusters, host clusters and other resources.
There are many [features](../../platform/) that are included as part of the vCluster Platform besides having a central management platform for virtual clusters. 

If you already have a vCluster Platform, [read more about how to deploy virtual clusters in the Platform](../../platform/virtual-clusters/create/).
