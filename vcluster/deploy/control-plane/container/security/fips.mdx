The [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/federal-information-processing-standards-fips) develops Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) to ensure the security and
interoperability of computer systems used by the U.S. government.

FIPS 140-2 is a U.S. Federal Government security standard used to approve
cryptographic modules. This document explains how vCluster Standalone and all its components
are built with FIPS-validated cryptographic libraries.

## Use of FIPS compatible Go toolchain

vCluster is written in [Go](https://go.dev/), and the FIPS-compliant builds
are compiled using the `GOFIPS140=v1.0.0` environment variable.
The FIPS 140-3 validated Go Cryptographic Module now underlies Go’s built-in crypto libraries, starting with the Go Cryptographic Module v1.0.0 that is included in Go 1.24.

### FIPS support in vCluster components

Most components used in vCluster are statically compiled with the GOFIPS140=v1.0.0 enabled Go compiler.
From a component perspective, vCluster includes multiple sub-components it depends on.

The list below contains components built in a FIPS-compliant manner:

- [Kubernetes API Server](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/kubernetes-fips)
- [Kubernetes Controller Manager](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/kubernetes-fips)
- [Kubernetes Scheduler](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/kubernetes-fips)
- [Kine](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/kine-fips)
- [ETCD](https://github.com/loft-sh/fips-builds/pkgs/container/etcd-fips)

:::caution
vCluster currently does not provide FIPS-compliant builds of
CoreDNS or Helm. One must use the integrated CoreDNS feature
of vCluster.

### FIPS vCluster Images

The vCluster FIPS-compliant images can be found in the vCluster [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-pro/pkgs/container/vcluster-pro-fips).

## Run a FIPS-compliant vCluster

To run vCluster in a FIPS environment, you must reconfigure the
repositories used to reference the FIPS images and enable CoreDNS.

The following is an example of a `vcluster.yaml` file that one can use to create
a FIPS-compliant vCluster instance:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    image:
      repository: loft-sh/vcluster-pro-fips
  distro:
    k8s:
      image:
        registry: ghcr.io
        repository: loft-sh/kubernetes
        tag: v1.33.5-fips # specify Kubernetes version here with -fips suffix
  coredns:
    embedded: true
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      embedded: # The use of embedded etcd is recommended, yet optional
        enabled: true
```

To create the FIPS-compliant vCluster instance, run:

```bash
vcluster create my-fips-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml
```

:::info

To use a different Kubernetes version in your virtual cluster than the host cluster, set the `controlPlane.distro.k8s.image.tag` field in your configuration:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  distro:
    k8s:
      image:
        tag: v1.34.2-fips
```
