The following section covers security recommendations for the direct configuration of Kubernetes control plane processes. The assessment focuses on API Server configuration and security settings, Controller Manager security parameters, Scheduler security configurations, and general control plane security practices.

Assessment focus for vCluster involves checking the extraArgs configurations in your `vcluster.yaml` file and ensuring proper security parameters are set for the virtualized API server, controller manager, and scheduler. Since vCluster virtualizes the control plane components, verification requires examining container processes rather than traditional system-level checks.

:::note Control numbering
The control numbers used throughout this guide (1.1.1, 1.2.1, etc.) correlate directly to the official CIS Kubernetes Benchmark control numbers. This allows you to cross-reference with the official CIS documentation and maintain consistency with standard security frameworks.
:::

:::note
For auditing each control, create the vCluster using default values as shown below, unless specified otherwise.
```bash
vcluster create my-vcluster --connect=false
```

## 1.1 Master node configuration files

### 1.1.1 Ensure that the API server pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not rely on static pod manifests stored on the host such as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` as found in kubeadm-based clusters. Instead, the vCluster API server runs as a separate binary embedded within the same container as the syncer pod. The architecture does not use the static pod mechanism, making the file permissions check defined in this control not applicable in the context of vCluster.

### 1.1.2 Ensure that the API server pod specification file ownership is set to root:root

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not rely on static pod manifests stored on the host such as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` as found in kubeadm-based clusters. Instead, the vCluster API server runs as a separate binary embedded within the same container as the syncer pod. The architecture does not use the static pod mechanism, making the file ownership check defined in this control not applicable in the context of vCluster.

### 1.1.3 Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not rely on static pod manifests stored on the host such as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` as found in kubeadm-based clusters. Instead, the vCluster controller manager runs as a separate binary embedded within the same container as the syncer pod. The architecture does not use the static pod mechanism, making the file permissions check defined in this control not applicable in the context of vCluster.

### 1.1.4 Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file ownership is set to root:root

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not rely on static pod manifests stored on the host such as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` as found in kubeadm-based clusters. Instead, the vCluster controller manager runs as a separate binary embedded within the same container as the syncer pod. The architecture does not use the static pod mechanism, making the file ownership check defined in this control not applicable in the context of vCluster.

### 1.1.5 Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not rely on static pod manifests stored on the host such as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` as found in kubeadm-based clusters. Instead, the vCluster scheduler runs as a separate binary embedded within the same container as the syncer pod. The architecture does not use the static pod mechanism, making the file permissions check defined in this control not applicable in the context of vCluster.

### 1.1.6 Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to root:root

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not rely on static pod manifests stored on the host such as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml` as found in kubeadm-based clusters. Instead, the vCluster scheduler runs as a separate binary embedded within the same container as the syncer pod. The architecture does not use the static pod mechanism, making the file ownership check defined in this control not applicable in the context of vCluster.

### 1.1.7 Ensure that the etcd pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not rely on static pod manifests stored on the host such as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` as found in kubeadm-based clusters. In case of embedded etcd, the etcd runs as a separate binary embedded within the same container as the syncer pod. The architecture does not use the static pod mechanism, making the file permissions check defined in this control not applicable in the context of vCluster.

### 1.1.8 Ensure that the etcd pod specification file ownership is set to root:root

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not rely on static pod manifests stored on the host such as `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` as found in kubeadm-based clusters. In case of embedded etcd, the etcd runs as a separate binary embedded within the same container as the syncer pod. The architecture does not use the static pod mechanism, making the file ownership check defined in this control not applicable in the context of vCluster.

### 1.1.9 Ensure that the Container Network Interface file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not configure or manage Container Network Interface (CNI) settings. Networking is handled entirely by the host (parent) cluster's CNI plugin. As a result, there are no CNI configuration files such as `/etc/cni/net.d/*.conf` present within the vCluster container. You should evaluate this control on the underlying host cluster as it is not applicable in vCluster environments.

### 1.1.10 Ensure that the Container Network Interface file ownership is set to root:root

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

vCluster does not configure or manage Container Network Interface (CNI) settings. Networking is handled entirely by the host (parent) cluster's CNI plugin. As a result, there are no CNI configuration files such as `/etc/cni/net.d/*.conf` present within the vCluster container. You should evaluate this control on the underlying host cluster as it is not applicable in vCluster environments.

### 1.1.11 Ensure that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive

**Result:** PASS

<Flow>
<Step>

Get the etcd data directory, passed as an argument to `--data-dir`, from the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec -n vcluster-my-vcluster my-vcluster-0 -c syncer -- ps -ef | grep etcd
```

</Step>
<Step>

Run the audit command to verify the permissions on the data directory. If they do not match the expected result, run the following command to set the appropriate permissions:

```bash
kubectl exec -n vcluster-my-vcluster my-vcluster-0 -c syncer -- chmod 700 /data/etcd
```

</Step>
</Flow>

**Audit:**
Run the following command against the vCluster pod:
```bash
kubectl exec -n vcluster-my-vcluster my-vcluster-0 -c syncer -- stat -c permissions=%a /data/etcd
```
Verify that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive.

**Expected results:**
```
permissions has value 700, expected 700 or more restrictive
```

**Returned value:**
```
permissions=700
```

### 1.1.12 Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

The control recommends that the etcd data directory be owned by the etcd user and group (etcd:etcd) to follow least privilege principles. However, in vCluster, etcd is embedded and runs as `root` within the syncer container. There is no separate etcd user present in the container. The directory ownership check defined in this control is not applicable in the context of vCluster.
