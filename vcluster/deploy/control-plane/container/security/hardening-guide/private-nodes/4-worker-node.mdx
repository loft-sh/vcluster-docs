The following section provides security recommendations for components running on Kubernetes worker nodes. The assessment focuses on Kubelet configuration and security and file system permissions.

Assessment focus for vCluster involves verifying and ensuring the private node meets these requirements.

:::note Control numbering
The control numbers used throughout this guide (4.1.1, 4.2.1, etc.) correlate directly to the official CIS Kubernetes Benchmark control numbers. This allows you to cross-reference with the official CIS documentation and maintain consistency with standard security frameworks.

## 4.1 Worker node configuration files

### 4.1.1 Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

**Result:** PASS

Run the audit command to verify the permissions on the service file. If they do not match the expected result, run the following command to set the appropriate permissions:

```
chmod 600 /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
```

**Audit:**

Run the following command against each node:

```bash
stat -c permissions=%a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
```

Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive.

**Expected results:**
```
permissions has value 600, expected 600 or more restrictive
```

**Returned value:**
```
permissions=600
```

### 4.1.2 Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root

**Result:** PASS

**Audit:**

Run the following command against each node:

```bash
stat -c %U:%G /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
```

Verify that the ownership is set to root:root.

**Expected results:**
```
root:root
```

**Returned value:**
```
root:root
```

### 4.1.3 If proxy kubeconfig file exists ensure permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

```bash
KUBE_PROXY_POD=$(kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-proxy -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
```

</Step>
<Step>

Save the below file for use with the debug container.
```yaml title="custom.json"
{
  "volumeMounts": [
    {
      "name": "kube-proxy",
      "mountPath": "/var/lib/kube-proxy"
    }
  ]
}
```

</Step>
</Flow>

**Audit:**

:::note
When both serverTLSBootstrap is true and RotateKubeletServerCertificate feature is enabled, instead of self signing a serving certificate, the Kubelet will request a certificate from the 'certificates.k8s.io' API. Ensure to approve the certificate signing requests (CSR) using `kubectl certificate approve <csr-name>`, for the following debug command to function.
:::

Run the following command against the kube-proxy pod:

```bash
kubectl debug --custom custom.json -it $KUBE_PROXY_POD --image=busybox --target=kube-proxy --namespace kube-system --profile=general -q -- stat -L -c permissions=%a /var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig.conf
```

    clientCAFile: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
...
```

### 4.2.4 Ensure that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0

**Result:** PASS

**Audit:**

If using a Kubelet configuration file, check that it does not set readOnlyPort to any value other than 0.

...
```

**Returned value:**
```
...
eventRecordQPS: 50
...
```

### 4.2.9 Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate

**Result:** NOT APPLICABLE

`--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file` are mutually exclusive with the `serverTLSBootrapping: true` setting (also recommended in Control 4.2.11).
These flags are required to be set when generating and distributing your own certificates to nodes. While serverTLSBootrapping: true switches to using the CSR certificate bootstrapping method, which bootstraps as well as auto-rotates the certificates.

### 4.2.10 Ensure that the --rotate-certificates argument is not set to false

**Result:** PASS

**Audit:**

If using a Kubelet configuration file, check that there is an entry to set rotateCertificates: to true.

Run the following command against each node:

```bash
cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

Verify that rotateCertificates is set to true.

**Expected results:**
```
...
rotateCertificates: true
...
```

**Returned value:**
```
...
rotateCertificates: true
...
```

### 4.2.11 Verify that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true

**Result:** PASS

<Flow>
<Step>
This check can be ignored if serverTLSBootstrap is true in the kubelet config file.

Pass the following configuration while creating the vCluster:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
privateNodes:
  enabled: true
  kubelet:
    config:
      serverTLSBootstrap: true
      featureGates:
        RotateKubeletServerCertificate: true
```

</Step>
<Step>

Create the vCluster using the above values file:

```bash
vcluster create my-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml --connect=false
```

</Step>
<Step>

Run the following command against each node:

```bash
cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

Verify that serverTLSBootstrap is set to true.

</Step>
</Flow>

**Expected results:**
```
...
serverTLSBootstrap: true
...
```

**Returned value:**
```
...
serverTLSBootstrap: true
...
```

:::note
When both serverTLSBootstrap is true and RotateKubeletServerCertificate feature is enabled, instead of self signing a serving certificate, the Kubelet will request a certificate from the 'certificates.k8s.io' API. This would require an approver to approve the certificate signing requests (CSR). 
:::

### 4.2.12 Ensure that the Kubelet only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers

**Result:** PASS

<Flow>
<Step>

Pass the following configuration while creating the vCluster:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
privateNodes:

      - "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
      - "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
      - "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
```

</Step>
<Step>

Create the vCluster using the above values file:

```bash
vcluster create my-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml --connect=false
```

</Step>
<Step>

Run the following command against each node:

```bash
cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
```

</Step>
</Flow>

**Expected results:**
```
...
tlsCipherSuites:
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
...
```

**Returned value:**
```
...
tlsCipherSuites:
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
...
```

### 4.2.13 Ensure that a limit is set on pod PIDs

**Result:** PASS

<Flow>
<Step>

Pass the following configuration while creating the vCluster:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
privateNodes:
  enabled: true
  kubelet:
    config:
      podPidsLimit: 1000000

```bash
cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
```

Verify that --pod-max-pids is set correctly.

</Step>
</Flow>

**Expected results:**
```
...
podPidsLimit: 1000000
...
```

**Returned value:**
```
...
podPidsLimit: 1000000
...
```


## 4.3 kube-proxy

### 4.3.1 Ensure that the kube-proxy metrics service is bound to localhost

**Result:** PASS

**Audit:**

kube-proxy runs as a pod inside the vCluster and its configuration is backed by a ConfigMap named "kube-proxy" in the kube-system namespace.

Run the following command inside the virtual cluster:

```bash
kubectl get cm kube-proxy -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.data.config\.conf}' | grep metricsBindAddress
```

Verify that metricsBindAddress is set to default.

**Expected results:**
```
metricsBindAddress: ""
```

**Returned value:**
```
metricsBindAddress: ""
```
