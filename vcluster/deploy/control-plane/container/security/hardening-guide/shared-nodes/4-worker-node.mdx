<!--vale off-->

The following section provides security recommendations for components running on Kubernetes worker nodes. The assessment focuses on Kubelet configuration and security and file system permissions.

Assessment focus for vCluster involves understanding that since vCluster uses the host cluster's nodes, these section requirements are primarily inherited from the host cluster's configuration. Verification should focus on ensuring the host cluster meets these requirements. Most controls in this section are marked as NOT APPLICABLE for vCluster deployments since the underlying node security is managed by the host cluster administrators.

:::note Control numbering
The control numbers used throughout this guide (4.1.1, 4.2.1, etc.) correlate directly to the official CIS Kubernetes Benchmark control numbers. This allows you to cross-reference with the official CIS documentation and maintain consistency with standard security frameworks.

```bash
chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubeadm.conf
```
