There are multiple ways to deploy and manage your vCluster. Review the different choices and choose the one that suits your needs.

## Predeployment configuration options

Before deploying, it's recommended to review the set of configuration options that cannot be updated post deployment. These options require deploying a new vCluster instead of upgrading your vCluster with new options.

<ControlPlaneOptions showHA="true" />
<WorkerNodeOptions />

## Prerequisites

Detailed instructions are provided for starting different types of host clusters, e.g. [EKS](./environment/eks), [AKS](./environment/aks), [GKE](./environment/gke) or [OpenShift](./environment/openshift).

## Deploy vCluster

:::tip YAML configuration
If you're not sure which options to configure, you can update most settings later by upgrading your vCluster with an updated `vcluster.yaml`.
However, some settings — such as what type of worker nodes or the backing store — can only be set during the initial deployment and cannot be changed during an upgrade.

## Deploy vCluster with the vCluster Platform

Virtual clusters can be deployed as standalone virtual clusters on host clusters as described above, but there is also a vCluster Platform that is a UI to manage your virtual clusters, host clusters and other resources.

There are many [features](/platform/) that are included as part of the vCluster Platform besides having a central management platform for virtual clusters.

If you already have vCluster Platform, [learn how to deploy virtual
clusters in the platform](/platform/use-platform/virtual-clusters/create/create-no-template).
