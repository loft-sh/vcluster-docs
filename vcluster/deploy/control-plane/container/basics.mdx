There are multiple ways to deploy and manage your vCluster. Review the different choices and choose the one that suits your needs.

## Deploy vCluster

All of the deployment options below have the following assumptions:

- A `vcluster.yaml` is provided. Refer to the `vcluster.yaml` [reference docs](../../../configure/vcluster-yaml/README.mdx) to explore all configuration options. This file is optional and can be removed from the examples.
- The vCluster is called `my-vcluster`.
- The vCluster is be deployed into the `team-x` namespace.

:::tip YAML configuration
If you're not sure which options to configure, you can update most settings later by upgrading your vCluster with an updated `vcluster.yaml`.
However, some settings—such as the backing store—can only be set during the initial deployment and cannot be changed during an upgrade.

## Deploy vCluster with the vCluster Platform

Virtual clusters can be deployed as standalone virtual clusters on host clusters as described above, but there is also a vCluster Platform that is a UI to manage your virtual clusters, host clusters and other resources.

There are many [features](/platform/) that are included as part of the vCluster Platform besides having a central management platform for virtual clusters.

If you already have vCluster Platform, [learn how to deploy virtual
clusters in the platform](/platform/use-platform/virtual-clusters/create/create-no-template).
