# Deploy with Flux
<!-- vale on -->

This guide shows how to deploy and manage virtual clusters using [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), a GitOps tool for Kubernetes. Flux uses GitOps to keep your Kubernetes clusters in sync with the desired state defined in your Git repository.

## Prerequisites

<BasePrerequisites />

Additionally, you'll need:

- A Kubernetes cluster with Flux controllers installed
- The `flux` CLI tool installed on your machine (See [Flux Installation Guide](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/))
- The `vcluster` CLI tool installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of GitOps principles

## Architecture options {#architecture-options}

When using Flux with virtual clusters, choose an architecture that aligns well with your GitOps workflow. You can configure Flux to work with virtual clusters in several ways, each offering different benefits and limitations.

:::info Flux and multi-cluster management
Unlike ArgoCD, which treats other clusters as first-class objects, Flux manages workloads on other clusters through KubeConfig references in `HelmRelease` and `Kustomization` resources. This difference in design influences how you'll structure your GitOps workflows when working with virtual clusters.
:::

:::tip Scaling considerations for ephemeral environments
The standalone approach—deploying Flux in each virtual cluster—might not scale effectively when managing large numbers of virtual clusters, particularly in ephemeral environments like pull request previews. In these cases, a hub-and-spoke model or a Flux instance per host cluster is typically more resource-efficient and can reduce the overhead of running multiple Flux controllers.
:::

The following are common approaches for integrating Flux with virtual clusters, each suited to different use cases:

### 1. Flux instance per host cluster {#flux-per-host}

When running Flux on each host cluster, it can manage the virtual clusters within that environment. This approach is recommended if you already use Flux for each traditional cluster and want to maintain a similar management pattern.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Git Repository] -->|reconciles| B1[Flux in Host 1]
    B1 -->|deploys| C1[vCluster 1]
    B1 -->|deploys| C2[vCluster 2]

    A -->|reconciles| B2[Flux in Host 2]
    B2 -->|deploys| C3[vCluster 3]
    B2 -->|deploys| C4[vCluster 4]
```

:::info Architecture characteristics
- One Flux instance per host cluster
- Each Flux instance manages multiple virtual clusters on that host
- Virtual cluster KubeConfig Secret management is simplified since Secrets are local to the cluster
- Clear separation of responsibilities by host cluster
- Recommended if you already use a Flux instance per traditional cluster
- Provides better resource utilization since the Flux controllers are shared
:::

### 2. Hub and spoke model {#hub-and-spoke}

With this approach, a central Flux instance manages multiple virtual clusters across different host clusters. This is a good option if you already use a single Flux instance with multiple Kubernetes clusters or if you want centralized control of all virtual environments.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Git Repository] -->|reconciles| B[Central Flux Instance]
    B -->|deploys to| C1[vCluster A in Host 1]
    B -->|deploys to| C2[vCluster B in Host 1]
    B -->|deploys to| C3[vCluster C in Host 2]
    B -->|deploys to| C4[vCluster D in Host 2]
```

:::info Architecture characteristics
- One central Flux instance manages multiple virtual clusters across different hosts
- Works well with existing hub and spoke Flux setups
- Requires secure KubeConfig Secret management between clusters
- More efficient for large numbers of virtual clusters
- Provides a single control point for all virtual cluster management
- Can simplify GitOps workflows by having a single source of truth
:::

### 3. Flux inside virtual clusters {#flux-inside-vclusters}

While possible, running Flux inside every virtual cluster adds resource overhead and management complexity. This approach might be suitable when virtual clusters need complete isolation and independent GitOps workflows.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Git Repository] -->|reconciles| B1[Flux in vCluster 1]
    A -->|reconciles| B2[Flux in vCluster 2]
    A -->|reconciles| B3[Flux in vCluster 3]

    B1 -->|deploys| C1[Workloads]
    B2 -->|deploys| C2[Workloads]
    B3 -->|deploys| C3[Workloads]
```

:::info Architecture characteristics
- Each virtual cluster runs its own Flux instance
- Provides complete isolation between environments
- Teams can manage their own GitOps workflows independently
- Increased resource overhead (each vCluster needs its own Flux controllers)
- More complex to manage at scale
- Suitable for environments where strict isolation is required

<!-- vale off -->
## Enable KubeConfig export {#enable-kubeconfig-export}
<!-- vale on -->

To enable Flux to deploy to virtual clusters, you must create a KubeConfig `Secret` that Flux can reference.

```yaml title="Configure KubeConfig export in vcluster.yaml"
exportKubeConfig:
  # Set a meaningful context name
  context: default
  # Use a server URL that is accessible from the Flux controllers
  server: https://vcluster-name.vcluster-namespace.svc.cluster.local:443
  # Skip TLS verification when Flux connects to the vCluster
  insecure: true
  # Specify the secret where the KubeConfig is stored
  secret:
    name: vcluster-flux-kubeconfig
controlPlane:
  proxy:
    extraSANs:
      - "vcluster-demo.vcluster-demo.svc.cluster.local"
```

This configuration:
- Exports the virtual cluster KubeConfig as a Secret in the host namespace
- Makes the Secret available for Flux to use with the `spec.kubeConfig` field
- Uses a server URL that is accessible from the Flux controllers (replace `vcluster-name` and `vcluster-namespace` with your actual values)
- Sets `insecure: true` to automatically skip TLS certificate verification
- Adds a TLS SAN (Subject Alternative Name) that matches the server URL, which helps prevent certificate verification errors

:::info KubeConfig Secret key
The vCluster `exportKubeConfig` configuration creates a Secret with the KubeConfig data stored under the key `config`. When referring to this Secret in Flux resources, you must specify this key in the `secretRef.key` field, as shown in the examples below.

```yaml
# In Flux HelmRelease
spec:
  kubeConfig:
    secretRef:
      name: vcluster-flux-kubeconfig
      key: config  # Must match the key used in the vCluster-generated Secret
```
:::

:::warning Certificate verification considerations
When using vCluster with Flux, proper TLS certificate configuration is essential:

1. Set `exportKubeConfig.insecure: true` in your vCluster configuration
2. Configure proper TLS SANs with the `--tls-san` flag in vCluster configuration
3. Ensure the server URL matches the certificate's SAN

```yaml
# In your vCluster configuration
controlPlane:
  proxy:
    extraSANs:
      - "vcluster-demo.vcluster-demo.svc.cluster.local"

exportKubeConfig:
  server: https://vcluster-name.vcluster-namespace.svc.cluster.local:443
  insecure: true
```

See the [Troubleshooting](#tls-certificate-verification-errors) section for solutions to certificate issues.
:::

## Predeployment configuration options

Before deploying, it's recommended to review the set of configuration options that cannot be updated post deployment. These options require deploying a new vCluster instead of upgrading your vCluster with new options.

<ControlPlaneOptions showHA="true" />
<WorkerNodeOptions />

## Deploy virtual clusters with Flux

<Flow id="flux-deploy-vcluster">
<Step>

<Highlight>Git Repository</Highlight> Create the vCluster Helm repository definition

Create a source for the vCluster Helm charts in your Git repository:

```yaml title="clusters/sources/vcluster-repository.yaml"
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: vcluster
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1h
  url: https://charts.loft.sh
```

</Step>

<Step>

<Highlight>Git Repository</Highlight> Define your vCluster configuration

Create a vCluster configuration file in your Git repository:

```yaml title="clusters/production/vcluster-demo.yaml"
---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: vcluster-demo
  namespace: vcluster-demo

  values:
    # Configure TLS SAN for the certificate
    controlPlane:
      proxy:
        extraSANs:
          - "vcluster-demo.vcluster-demo.svc.cluster.local"
      coredns:
        enabled: true

    exportKubeConfig:
      # Set a meaningful context name

    sync:
      toHost:
        ingresses:
          enabled: true
      
```

You can include any standard vCluster configuration in the `values` section.

</Step>

<Step>

<Highlight>Kubernetes Cluster</Highlight> Apply the vCluster namespace

Before applying the `HelmRelease`, ensure that the target namespace exists:

```bash title="Create the namespace"
kubectl create namespace vcluster-demo
```

</Step>

<Step>

<Highlight>Git Repository</Highlight> Commit and push your changes

```bash title="Commit and push to the repository"
git add clusters/
git commit -m "Add vCluster demo configuration"
git push
```

Flux detects the changes and deploy the vCluster according to your configuration.

</Step>
</Flow>

## Deploy applications to virtual clusters

After the vCluster is up and running, use Flux to deploy applications directly into the virtual cluster.

<Flow id="flux-deploy-apps">
<Step>

<Highlight>Git Repository</Highlight> Create a Helm repository source

          paths:
            - path: /
              pathType: Prefix
```

:::tip Handling TLS certificate verification
The `kubeConfig` section references the `Secret` created by the vCluster using the `exportKubeConfig` setting. To allow Flux to connect to the virtual cluster with a self-signed certificate, you must configure both Flux and vCluster to permit insecure TLS connections:

- **Flux Helm Controller configuration**:  
  Add the `--insecure-kubeconfig-tls` flag to the [Helm Controller configuration](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/helm/options/). This allows Flux to honor `insecure-skip-tls-verify: true` in the referenced kubeconfig and skip certificate verification when connecting to the virtual cluster.  
  > **Warning:** This approach skips TLS certificate verification and is not recommended for production environments.

- **vCluster configuration**:  
  Ensure your vCluster config includes both the TLS SAN and `insecure: true` settings, as shown in the previous example. This enables the vCluster API server to serve with a self-signed (or otherwise untrusted) certificate and accept insecure connections.

- **If you still encounter certificate errors**: Use a modified `Secret` created with the solution in the [troubleshooting section](#tls-certificate-verification-errors):

```yaml title="Use a modified KubeConfig Secret"
kubeConfig:
  secretRef:
    name: vcluster-flux-kubeconfig-modified  # Use the modified Secret
    key: config
```
:::

</Step>

<Step>

<Highlight>Git Repository</Highlight> Commit and push your changes

```bash title="Commit and push application definitions"
git add vcluster-apps/
git commit -m "Add podinfo application for vCluster demo"
git push
```

</Step>

<Step>

<Highlight color="green">Virtual Cluster</Highlight> Verify deployment

After Flux reconciles the changes, you can connect to your vCluster and verify the application is deployed:

```bash title="Connect to vCluster and check deployment"
vcluster connect vcluster-demo -n vcluster-demo

# Check the deployment in the virtual cluster
kubectl get namespace podinfo
kubectl get pods -n podinfo
kubectl get ingress -n podinfo
```

</Step>
</Flow>

## Manage multiple virtual clusters {#manage-multiple-vclusters}

When managing multiple virtual clusters with Flux, you can use Kustomize to organize your configurations.

```yaml title="clusters/kustomization.yaml"
---
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - sources/vcluster-repository.yaml
  - development/vcluster-dev.yaml
  - staging/vcluster-staging.yaml
  - production/vcluster-prod.yaml
```

## Bootstrap review environments with pre-installed Flux {#bootstrapping-review-environments}

A common scenario is having Flux already installed on the host cluster and wanting to use it for ephemeral review environments with virtual clusters. This approach follows GitOps principles while avoiding the need to install Flux separately for each environment.

### Use ResourceSet feature for review environments {#flux-resource-sets}

For later versions of Flux, you can use the native Flux Operator `ResourceSet` capability to manage ephemeral environments efficiently. This is a feature for creating review environments that include virtual clusters.

```yaml title="pr-resource-set.yaml"
apiVersion: resourcesets.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1alpha2
kind: ResourceSet
metadata:
  name: pr-123
  namespace: reviews
spec:
  interval: 5m
  serviceAccountName: flux-reconciler
  resources:
    # First create the vCluster
    - apiVersion: v1
      kind: Namespace
      metadata:
        name: review-123
      
    - apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2
      kind: HelmRelease
      metadata:
        name: vcluster-pr-123
        namespace: review-123
      spec:
        interval: 10m
        chart:
          spec:
            chart: vcluster
            version: "0.24.x"
            sourceRef:
              kind: HelmRepository
              name: vcluster
              namespace: flux-system
        values:
          exportKubeConfig:
            context: default
            server: https://vcluster-pr-123.review-123.svc.cluster.local:443
            insecure: true
            secret:
              name: vcluster-pr-123-kubeconfig
    
    # Deploy the PR app code into the vCluster
    - apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2
      kind: HelmRelease
      metadata:
        name: pr-app
        namespace: review-123
      spec:
        interval: 5m
        chart:
          spec:
            chart: ./charts/app
            sourceRef:
              kind: GitRepository
              name: pull-request-123
              namespace: flux-system
        kubeConfig:
          secretRef:
            name: vcluster-pr-123-kubeconfig
            key: config
          skipTLSVerify: true
        values:
          image:
            tag: pr-123
```

This approach allows you to:
- Create the vCluster and deploy applications in a single resource
- Use the Flux Operator directly without having to create custom CI scripts
- Simplify the cleanup when a PR is closed or merged
- Manage the entire lifecycle of review environments through GitOps practices

For more details, see the [Flux Operator `ResourceSet` documentation](https://fluxcd.control-plane.io/operator/resourcesets/github-pull-requests/) and an [example implementation](https://github.com/loft-demos/vcluster-platform-demo-app-template/blob/main/vcluster-use-cases/flux/pull-request-environments/pr-resource-set.yaml).

### Use existing Flux for review environments

When Flux is already installed on your host cluster, you can create a GitOps workflow for review environments that:

1. Uses the existing Flux installation on the host cluster
2. Deploys virtual clusters for each review environment
3. Use Flux to deploy applications to these virtual clusters
4. Reduces overhead and speeds up environment bootstrapping

<Highlight>CI Pipeline</Highlight> Create a CI workflow that generates environments

```yaml title="CI workflow (conceptual)"

    run: |
      export PR_NUMBER=${GITHUB_REF#refs/pull/}
      export PR_NUMBER=${PR_NUMBER%/merge}
      mkdir -p clusters/reviews/pr-${PR_NUMBER}

      # Generate the vCluster config from template
      cat clusters/reviews/review-env-template.yaml | \
        sed "s/\${PR_NUMBER}/$PR_NUMBER/g" > \
        clusters/reviews/pr-${PR_NUMBER}/vcluster.yaml

  - name: Commit and push to GitOps repo
    run: |
      git add clusters/reviews/pr-${PR_NUMBER}
      git commit -m "Add review environment for PR #${PR_NUMBER}"
      git push
```

With this approach, your CI/CD pipeline creates the necessary configuration in your GitOps repository, and Flux (already running on the host cluster) automatically provisions the vCluster and deploys applications to it.

</Step>
<Step>

<Highlight>Host Cluster</Highlight> Existing Flux detects and applies changes

The Flux controllers already running on your host cluster is going to:

- Detect the new vCluster configuration
- Create the required namespace
- Deploy the vCluster using the Helm chart
- Create the KubeConfig `Secret`
- Use the exported KubeConfig to deploy apps to the vCluster

This entire process follows GitOps principles, with your Git repository as the source of truth, and Flux handling the reconciliation—all without requiring manual intervention or imperative commands.

</Step>
</Flow>

:::tip
In production environments, implement automatic cleanup of preview environments when pull requests are closed or merged. You can do this by adding a CI workflow step that deletes the corresponding directory from your GitOps repository.
:::

This pattern allows you to use an existing Flux installation rather than deploying Flux separately for each review environment. This significantly reduces overhead and bootstrap time.

:::tip Advanced management with vCluster Platform
For organizations managing many virtual clusters—especially in dynamic, ephemeral environments—vCluster Platform offers advanced lifecycle management capabilities that integrate smoothly with GitOps workflows. It supports automatic creation of KubeConfig `Secrets`, access control management, and simplified bootstrapping of virtual clusters with Flux.
:::

## Troubleshoot

<Highlight>Host Cluster</Highlight>
- Verify the virtual cluster KubeConfig `Secret` exists with the correct format
- Check Flux controller logs for errors
- Ensure Flux has the necessary permissions to access the `Secret`

```bash title="Check Flux source controller logs"
kubectl logs -n flux-system deployment/source-controller
```

```bash title="Check Flux helm controller logs"
kubectl logs -n flux-system deployment/helm-controller
```

<Highlight color="green">Virtual Cluster</Highlight>
- Verify that resources are being created in the virtual cluster
- Check that the `exportKubeConfig` setting is properly configured
- Ensure the server URL is reachable from the Flux controllers

```bash title="Check virtual cluster configuration"
kubectl get configmap -n vcluster-namespace vcluster-flux-demo -o yaml
```

### Common issues

<!-- vale off -->
#### TLS certificate verification errors {#tls-certificate-verification-errors}
<!-- vale on -->

If you see TLS certificate verification errors in Flux controller logs like:

```
tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

This is a common issue when Flux attempts to connect to a vCluster, because the vCluster generates a self-signed certificate. Follow these solutions in order:

<!-- vale off -->
##### Solution 1: Properly configure vCluster certificate SANs
<!-- vale on -->

The most reliable approach is to configure proper TLS SANs when deploying vCluster:

```yaml title="vCluster configuration with proper TLS SANs"
controlPlane:
  proxy:
    extraSANs:
      - "vcluster-demo.vcluster-demo.svc.cluster.local"

exportKubeConfig:
  server: https://vcluster-name.vcluster-namespace.svc.cluster.local:443
  insecure: true
  secret:
    name: vcluster-flux-kubeconfig
```

This ensures the certificate includes the correct SAN for the service DNS name.

<!-- vale off -->
##### Solution 2: Use a modified KubeConfig Secret
<!-- vale on -->

If you're still encountering issues, create a modified KubeConfig `Secret` with TLS verification disabled:

```bash title="Create a modified KubeConfig Secret"
# Set your environment variables
NAMESPACE="vcluster-namespace"
VCLUSTER_NAME="vcluster-name"
KUBECONFIG_SECRET="vcluster-flux-kubeconfig"

# Create a temporary directory
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
cd $TMPDIR

# Extract original kubeconfig
kubectl get secret -n $NAMESPACE $KUBECONFIG_SECRET -o jsonpath='{.data.config}' | base64 -d > original-kubeconfig.yaml

# Extract client certificates
CLIENT_CERT=$(grep -A1 "client-certificate-data:" original-kubeconfig.yaml | tail -n1 | awk '{print $1}')
CLIENT_KEY=$(grep -A1 "client-key-data:" original-kubeconfig.yaml | tail -n1 | awk '{print $1}')

# Create KubeConfig without certificate-authority-data and with insecure-skip-tls-verify enabled
cat > modified-kubeconfig.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://${VCLUSTER_NAME}.${NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local:443
  name: default
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: default
    user: default
  name: default
current-context: default
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: default
  user:
    client-certificate-data: ${CLIENT_CERT}
    client-key-data: ${CLIENT_KEY}
EOF

# Create Secret
kubectl create secret generic ${KUBECONFIG_SECRET}-modified -n $NAMESPACE --from-file=config=modified-kubeconfig.yaml

# Clean up
rm -rf $TMPDIR
```

Update your Flux resource to use this `Secret`:

```yaml title="Update HelmRelease or Kustomization"
spec:
  kubeConfig:
    secretRef:
      name: vcluster-flux-kubeconfig-modified
      key: config
```

<!-- vale off -->
##### Solution 3: Use Flux's built-in TLS verification options
<!-- vale on -->

To allow Flux (v2+) to connect to a virtual cluster with a self-signed certificate, you must configure the Flux Helm Controller to permit insecure TLS connections:

- **Add `--insecure-kubeconfig-tls` to the Helm Controller**  
  Ensure the Helm Controller is started with the `--insecure-kubeconfig-tls` flag. This enables Flux to honor `insecure-skip-tls-verify: true` inside the referenced kubeconfig Secret and skip certificate verification for the target (virtual) cluster.

```yaml title="Patch Helm Controller with --insecure-kubeconfig-tls"
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- gotk-components.yaml
- gotk-sync.yaml

patches:
  - patch: |
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-
        value: --insecure-kubeconfig-tls  
    target:
      kind: Deployment
      name: "helm-controller"
```

#### Connection refused errors

If you see "connection refused" errors in the Flux controller logs, it might indicate:
1. The virtual cluster's API server is not accessible from Flux
2. Network policies are blocking the communication
3. The virtual cluster is not running or healthy
4. The server URL in the KubeConfig is not correctly configured

You might see errors in the Flux controller logs like:

```
connect: connection refused
```

To troubleshoot:

1. Check if the virtual cluster is running and ready:
```bash title="Verify vCluster status"
kubectl get pods -n <vcluster-namespace>
```

2. Verify the server URL in your `exportKubeConfig` setting:
```bash title="Check server URL in KubeConfig"
kubectl get secret -n <vcluster-namespace> <kubeconfig-secret-name> -o jsonpath='{.data.config}' | base64 -d | grep server
```

3. Ensure the server URL is accessible from the Flux controllers. Using the service DNS name is generally more reliable:
```yaml title="Recommended server URL format"
server: https://vcluster-name.vcluster-namespace.svc.cluster.local:443
```
