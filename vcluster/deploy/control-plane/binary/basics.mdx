## Overview 

When deploying vCluster Standalone, the assets required to install the control plane are located in 
the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases) of vCluster. 

## Predeployment configuration options

Before deploying, it's recommended to review the set of configuration options
 that cannot be updated post deployment. These options require deploying a new 
 vCluster instead of upgrading your vCluster with new options.

### Control Plane Options

* [High availability](./high-availability) - Run multiple control plane nodes
* [Core DNS](../../../configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/coredns) - Currently only coreDNS deployed by vCluster during startup is supported.
* Backing Store - Decide how the data of your cluster is stored, must be one of either [embedded SQLite](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/database/sqlite) (the default) or [embedded etcd](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/embedded).

### Control Plane Node Roles

Decide if the control plane node will also be a worker node or not. 

### Worker Nodes

 With vCluster Standalone, worker nodes can only be [private nodes](../../worker-nodes/private-nodes). Since there is no host cluster, 
 there is no concept of host nodes. 

## Prerequisites

- Access to a node that satisfies the [node requirements](./node-requirements) 

## Install Control Plane Node

:::tip Control Plane Node
All steps are perfomed on the control plane node.
:::
<Flow>
    <Step>
        Save a basic `vcluster.yaml` configuration file for vCluster Standalone on the control plane node.

        ```bash title="Create a vcluster.yaml for vCluster Standalone with only one control plane node"   
        cat <<EOF > vcluster.yaml
        controlPlane:
          standalone:
            enabled: true
            joinNode:
              enabled: true  # Optional: Control Plane node will also be considered a worker node 
        privateNodes: # Required for adding additional worker nodes
          enabled: true
        EOF
        ```

        :::warning 
        Adding additional control plane nodes will not be supported unless you follow the [high availability](./high-availability) steps for configuration.
        :::
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Run the installation script on the control plane node:

        ```bash title="Install vCluster Standalone on control plane node"
        export VCLUSTER_VERSION="v0.29.0"
        
        sudo su -
        curl -sfL https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases/download/${VCLUSTER_VERSION}/install-standalone.sh | sh -s -- --vcluster-name standalone --config ${PWD}/vcluster.yaml
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step>
        Check that the control plane node is ready. 
        
        After installation, the kubeconfig is automatically configured on the control plane node.
        The kubectl context is set to interact with your new vCluster Standalone instance.

        Run these commands on the control plane node:

        ```bash title="Check node status"
        kubectl get nodes
        ```
        
        Expected output:
        ```bash
        NAME               STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
        ip-192-168-3-131   Ready    control-plane,master   11m   v1.32.1
        ```
        
        ```bash title="Verify cluster components are running"
        kubectl get pods -A
        ```

        Pods should include:
        - **Flannel**: CNI for container networking
        - **CoreDNS**: DNS service for the cluster
        - **KubeProxy**: Network traffic routing and load balancing
        - **Konnectivity**: Secure control plane to worker node communication
        - **Local Path Provisioner**: Dynamic storage provisioning
    </Step>

</Flow>

## Accessing your cluster

After installation, the kubeconfig is automatically configured on the control plane node. The kubectl context is set to interact with your new vCluster Standalone instance.

To access the cluster from other machines, copy the kubeconfig from `/var/lib/vcluster/kubeconfig.yaml` on the control plane node, then replace the server field with relevant IP or DNS in order to access the cluster.

The vCluster CLI is installed at `/var/lib/vcluster/bin/vcluster-cli`
