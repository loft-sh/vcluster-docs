## Hardware requirements
The recommended resource configuration for vCluster Standalone is as follows:
```yaml title="Resource requirements"
resources:
      limits:
        ephemeral-storage: 10Gi
        memory: 4Gi
      requests:
        ephemeral-storage: 1Gi
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 512Mi
```
Adjust the exact number based on your cluster size and workload if necessary.

## Installation overview

vCluster Standalone requires having dedicated nodes to build your control plane nodes and optionally add additional worker nodes. 

The steps are to bring up a vCluster Standalone cluster are:

1. Install an initial control plane node.
2. (Optional) Join additional control plane nodes.
3. (Optional) Join worker nodes.

## vcluster.yaml configuration

To create a vCluster Standalone with one node that is the control plane and worker node. Read more about [high availability](./high-availability).

```yaml title="Enable standalone"
controlPlane:
  # Enable standalone
  standalone:
    enabled: true
    joinNode:
      enabled: true  # Optional: Control Plane node will also be considered a worker node 
  distro:
    k8s:
      image:
        tag: v1.31.2 # Kubernetes version you want to use
  service:
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer # If you want to expose vCluster using LoadBalancer (Recommended option)

# Required for adding additional worker nodes
privateNodes: 
  enabled: true
  
# Networking configuration
networking:
  # Specify the pod CIDR
  podCIDR: 10.64.0.0/16
  # Specify the service CIDR
  serviceCIDR: 10.128.0.0/16
