## Compute resource requirements
The minimal recommended resource requirements for vCluster Standalone are as follows:

## Installation overview

vCluster Standalone needs its own set of nodes for the control plane, and you can add extra nodes later if you want them to act as workers. 
The steps are to bring up a vCluster Standalone cluster are:

1. Install an initial control plane node.
2. (Optional) Join additional control plane nodes.
3. (Optional) Join worker nodes.

## vcluster.yaml configuration

To create a vCluster Standalone with one node that is the control plane and worker node. Read more about [high availability](./high-availability).

```yaml title="Enable standalone"
