## vCluster Standalone

vCluster Standalone is a different architecture model for vCluster for the control plane and node as there is no requirement
of a host cluster. vCluster is deployed directly onto nodes like other Kubernetes distribution. vCluster Standalone can
 run on any type of node, whether that is a bare-metal node or VM. It provides the strictest isolation for workloads as there is no shared host cluster for the control plane or worker nodes.
 
When enabling vCluster Standalone, the control plane is now no longer on a shared host cluster, but on its own independent node. Worker
nodes must be [private nodes](../../worker-nodes/private-nodes).

## Installation Overview

vCluster Standalone requires having dedicated nodes to build your control plane nodes and optionally add additional worker nodes. 

The steps are to bring up a vCluster Standalone cluster are:

1. Install an initial control plane node. 
2. (Optional) Join additional control plane nodes. 
3. (Optional) Join worker nodes. 


## vcluster.yaml configuration

To create a vCluster Standalone with one node that is the control plane and worker node. Read more about [high availability](./high-availability).

```yaml title="Enable standalone"

controlPlane:
  # Enable standalone
  standalone:
    enabled: true
      joinNode:
        enabled: true  # Optional: Control Plane node will also be considered a worker node 
  distro:
    k8s:
      image:
        tag: v1.31.2 # Kubernetes version you want to use
  service:
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer # If you want to expose vCluster using LoadBalancer (Recommended option)

# Required for adding additional worker nodes
privateNodes: 
  enabled: true
  
# Networking configuration
networking:
  # Specify the pod CIDR
  podCIDR: 10.64.0.0/16
  # Specify the service CIDR
  serviceCIDR: 10.128.0.0/16
