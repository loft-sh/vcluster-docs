## Update vCluster Standalone configuration

Changing the `vcluster.yaml` configuration can be done on any of the control plane nodes.

<Flow>
  <Step>
    Modify the `vcluster.yaml`.

    The `vcluster.yaml` is located at: `/var/lib/vcluster/config.yaml`. Edit and save your changes.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Restart vCluster systemD service to deploy your changes. 
    
    ```bash title="Restart vCluster"
    systemctl restart vcluster.service
    ```

    By default, the changes automatically start to propogate to any additional control plane nodes. If you've disabled synchronizing
    the configuration with `controlPlane.standalone.syncConfig.enabled=false`, then changes will not propogate.
  </Step>
</Flow>

## Remove vCluster

### Control plane only nodes 

If you have not enabled joining the control plane nodes as worker nodes, then removing vCluster
is as simple as stopping the service and removing files from the nodes. 

<Flow>
  <Step>
    Stop the vCluster service on the control plane node.

    ```bash title="Stop vCluster service"
    systemctl stop vcluster.service
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Remove vCluster files on the control plane node.
    
    ```bash title="Clean up vCluster files"
    rm -rf /var/lib/vcluster && rm /etc/systemd/system/vcluster.service
    ```
  </Step>
</Flow>

### Control plane nodes that are also workers 

Any control plane nodes that are also worker nodes need to follow the [worker node removal steps](../../worker-nodes/private-nodes/manage/#remove-vcluster).
