## Control plane node requirements

- Network connectivity between any control plane and worker nodes being used for the cluster 

## OS requirements

- Linux distribution with SystemD support (required for service management)
- `iptables` binaries installed (automatically available on Ubuntu, may need manual installation on other distributions)
- `curl` installed
- Root user access
- Increased fs.inotify resource limits (defined by `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` and `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` system variables. For example, in Ubuntu these default to 8192 and 128 respectively, which is not enough.)

:::warning
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is currently not supported.
