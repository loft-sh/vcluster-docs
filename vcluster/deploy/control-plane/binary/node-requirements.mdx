## Control plane node requirements

- Network connectivity between any control plane and worker nodes being used for the cluster 

## OS requirements

- Linux distribution with SystemD support (required for service management)
- `iptables` binaries installed (automatically available on Ubuntu, may need manual installation on other distributions)
- `curl` installed
- Root user access
- Increased inotify watchers on each node. fs.inotify resource limits (defined by `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` and `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` system variables. For example, in Ubuntu these default to 8192 and 128 respectively, which is not enough.)

:::warning
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is currently not supported.

### Increase the inotify watchers limit 

Log into each node and manually increase the watchers limit.

<Flow>
    <Step>
    Log into the Node. Use SSH or your preferred method for node access.

    </Step>
    <Step>
    Confirm the current inotify watchers limit by running:

    ```bash
    cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Increase the limit temporarily.

    ```bash
    sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
    ````
    Adjust the value as needed; 524288 is typically sufficient.

    </Step>
    <Step>
    Increase the limit permanently. 

    To make the change persistent across reboots, add it to the sysctl configuration:

    ```bash
    echo "fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    sudo sysctl -p
    ```

    </Step>
</Flow>
