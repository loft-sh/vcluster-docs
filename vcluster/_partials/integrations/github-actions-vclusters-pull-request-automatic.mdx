This example shows how to automatically delete a Virtual Cluster after testing an application named `the-app` for pull requests.

```yaml {20}
# .github/workflows/vclusters.yaml
name: Pull Request Checks
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - 'main'
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install vCluster CLI
        uses: loft-sh/setup-loft@main
        with:
          url: ${{ secrets.LOFT_URL }}
          access-key: ${{ secrets.LOFT_ACCESS_KEY }}
      - name: Create Virtual Cluster for PR
        uses: loft-sh/create-vcluster@main
        with:
          name: pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}-${{ github.sha }}-${{ github.run_id }}
          auto-cleanup: true
      - name: Deploy Application
        run: kubectl apply -Rf ./kubernetes
      - name: Wait for Deployment
        run: kubectl rollout status deployments/the-app
      - name: Run Tests
        run: make e2e
```

**Explanation:**
1. The [Setup Loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/setup-loft) action is used to install the vCluster CLI and login using the provided `url` and `access-key`.
2. The [Create Virtual Cluster](https://github.com/loft-sh/create-vcluster) action is used to create a unique virtual cluster using information about the pull request. This automatically configures the kube context for the following steps. Additionally, the `auto-cleanup` option is enabled, which deletes the virtual cluster after the job completes.
3. The next step deploys the application using the runner provided `kubectl` and manifests located under `./kubernetes`.
4. Before running tests, use `kubectl` to wait for the `the-app` deployment to become ready.
5. Finally, run the end-to-end tests. This example uses `make` to run tests, but the command should be customized for your testing framework. There's no need to delete the virtual cluster since the `auto-cleanup` option was used when creating the virtual cluster.
