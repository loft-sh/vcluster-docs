Configure features in a `vcluster.yaml` file. These examples show you how to configure some popular features. See the `vcluser.yaml` [configuration reference](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/) for how to configure additional features.

    <summary>Expose the vCluster control plane</summary>

    There are multiple ways of granting access to the vCluster control plane for external applications like kubectl. The following example uses an Ingress, but you can also do it via ServiceAccount, LoadBalancer, and NodePort.

    <Flow>
        <Step>
           
            Modify `vcluster.yaml` so that vCluster creates the required Ingress resource.

            ```yaml
            controlPlane:
                ingress:
                    enabled: true
                    host: $VCLUSTER_HOSTNAME
                proxy:
                    extraSANs:
                    - $VCLUSTER_HOSTNAME
            ```

            Replace `$VCLUSTER_HOSTNAME` with the hostname of the vCluster instance.

    <summary>Show real nodes</summary>

        By default, vCluster syncs pseudo nodes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. However, deploying a vCluster instance via the CLI on a local Kubernetes cluster automatically enables real node syncing, so you would not see a difference in this context.

        Pseudo nodes only have real values for the CPU, architecture, and operating system, while everything else is randomly generated. Therefore, for use cases requiring real node information, you can opt to sync the real nodes into the virtual cluster.

        <Flow>
                <Step>
                
                    Modify `vcluster.yaml` to sync the nodes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster.

                    ```yaml
                    sync:
                      fromHost:
                        nodes:
                          enabled: true
                    ```

                </Step>
                <Step>
                    Apply your changes.

    <summary>Sync ingress from host cluster to virtual cluster</summary>

        If you want to use an ingress controller from the host cluster inside your virtual cluster, enable `IngressClass` syncing from the host cluster to virtual cluster.

        <Flow>
            <Step>
            
                Modify `vcluster.yaml` to sync the IngressClasses from the host cluster to the virtual cluster.

                ```yaml
                sync:
                  fromHost:
                    ingressClasses:
                      enabled: true
                ``` 

            </Step>

    <summary>Sync ingress from virtual cluster to host cluster</summary>

        Create an ingress in a virtual cluster to make a service in that virtual cluster available via a hostname/domain. Instead of having to run a separate ingress controller in each virtual cluster, sync the ingress resource to the host cluster so that the virtual cluster can use a shared ingress controller running in the host cluster.

        <Flow>
            <Step>
            
                Modify `vcluster.yaml` to sync the ingresses from the virtual cluster to the host cluster.

                ```yaml
                sync:
                  toHost:
                    ingresses:
                      enabled: true
                ``` 

            </Step>
            <Step>
                Apply your changes.

    <summary>Sync services from host cluster to virtual cluster</summary>

        In this example, you map a service `my-host-service` in the namespace `my-host-namespace` to the virtual cluster service `my-virtual-service` inside the virtual cluster namespace `team-x`.

        <Flow>
            <Step>
            
                Modify `vcluster.yaml` to sync the ingresses from the virtual cluster to the host cluster.

                ```yaml
                replicateServices:
                  fromHost:
                    - from: my-host-namespace/my-host-service
                      to: team-x/my-virtual-service
                ```

            </Step>
            <Step>
                Apply your changes.
