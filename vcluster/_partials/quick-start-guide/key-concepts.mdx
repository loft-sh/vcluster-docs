Before deploying a vCluster, it's important to understand the components of a virtual cluster and how that creates 
a certain level of tenancy for your virtual cluster. 

- [**Tenancy Models**](./introduction/architecture): Different tenancy models can be achieved based on how the vCluster is built, but the main two
components that will dictate your tenancy models are the vCluster control plane and worker nodes.
- [**vCluster Control Plane**](./introduction/architecture#virtual-control-plane): Contains a Kubernetes API server, a controller manager and a data store mount. 
- [**Worker Nodes**](./configure/tenancy-model): Worker nodes can be either from the host cluster that the vCluster control plane is deployed on.
