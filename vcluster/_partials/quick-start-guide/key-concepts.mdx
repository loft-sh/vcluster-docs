- [**vCluster Control Plane**](/vcluster/introduction/architecture#virtual-control-plane): Contains a Kubernetes API server, a controller manager, a data store mount and the Syncer.
- [**Syncing resources**](/vcluster/introduction/architecture#syncer): vCluster runs your workloads by syncing pods from the virtual cluster to the host cluster.
- Pod scheduling: By default, vCluster reuses the host cluster scheduler to schedule workloads.
- Storage: You can use the host's storage classes without the need to create them in the virtual cluster.
- [**Networking**](/vcluster/introduction/architecture#networking-in-virtual-clusters): vCluster syncs resources such as Service and Ingress resources from the virtual to the host cluster.
- Nodes: By default, vCluster creates pseudo nodes for every pod `spec.nodeName` in the virtual cluster.
