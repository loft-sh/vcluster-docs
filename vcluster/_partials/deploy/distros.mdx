vCluster is deployed with its own Kubernetes distribution that does not need to match with the host cluster's distribution. For example, 
you can deploy virtual clusters with the K8s distro on top of EKS clusters. 


:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, changing the Kubernetes distribution of vCluster is not supported.
:::

By default, the distribution of vCluster is vanilla Kubernetes (K8s) and is the recommended distribution to use. 

The following distributions are supported for virtual clusters:
  
- **K8s**: By default, vCluster uses vanilla Kubernetes. This is the recommended distribution.
- [**K3s**](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s): A lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments, remote locations, and IoT devices. K3s is only supported for control plane as a container and worker nodes as host nodes.

<HostClusterCompat distro="any supported Kubernetes distribution"/>

### Host cluster compatibility

vCluster supports specific Kubernetes versions on host clusters. For more information, see the [Kubernetes compatibility matrix](../../deploy/upgrade/supported_versions.mdx#kubernetes-compatibility-matrix).
