You can always introduce or update your `vcluster.yaml` and deploy new configuration options.

The vCluster control plane pod is going to be re-deployed.

:::warning Limitations on changing configuration
You cannot change distros once a virtual cluster is deployed, with one exception: starting with vCluster 0.25.0, migration from K3s to K8s distro is supported. For more details, see the [K3s to K8s migration guide](/vcluster/deploy/upgrade/distro-migration.mdx).
