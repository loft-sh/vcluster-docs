# Sleep and wakeup vCluster

This page describes how to **manually** put a virtual cluster to sleep and wake it up using CLI commands. This is different from auto sleep, which automatically manages sleep and wake operations based on activity detection or schedules.

## Manual vs auto sleep

There are two ways to manage sleep for virtual clusters:

- **Manual sleep** (this page): Use CLI commands to manually put a vCluster to sleep or wake it up. This is a free feature available to all users.
- **Auto sleep**: Configure the vCluster to automatically sleep and wake based on inactivity detection, schedules, or ingress activity. This is an enterprise feature. For details, see the [Auto Sleep configuration documentation](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sleep.mdx).

When you manually put a virtual cluster to sleep, it **temporarily scales down** the cluster and deletes all its created workloads on the host cluster. This approach helps **save computing resources** used by virtual cluster workloads in the host cluster. For example, sleeping development clusters during non-working hours can significantly reduce infrastructure costs.


## Prerequisites

<BasePrerequisites />
- `vCluster` CLI
  <InstallCli />


## Put a vCluster to sleep

Put a virtual cluster to sleep manually with the `vCluster` CLI:

```bash title="Sleep a virtual cluster"
vcluster platform sleep my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```

### What happens during manual sleep

This command performs the following actions:
- Scales down any StatefulSets or Deployments in the virtual cluster
- Deletes all workloads created by the virtual cluster on the host cluster

While the command preserves object definitions within the virtual cluster, any standalone pods (those without a controlling replica set or StatefulSet) need to be restarted when the cluster wakes up.

:::warning Restarting pods
When pods are restarted:
- The temporary filesystem is erased
- Pod IP addresses change

### Differences from auto sleep

Manual sleep differs from auto sleep in several ways:

- **Control**: Manual sleep requires explicit CLI commands; auto sleep manages sleep and wake operations automatically based on configuration.
- **Activity detection**: Manual sleep doesn't detect activity or wake automatically; auto sleep can detect API calls, ingress traffic, and other activity to wake the cluster.
- **Scheduling**: Manual sleep doesn't support schedules; auto sleep can sleep and wake on specific schedules (for example, weekends or off-hours).
- **Resource management**: Manual sleep scales down workloads but keeps the control plane active; auto sleep (when connected to the platform via agent) can shut down the control plane completely for greater resource savings.

For auto sleep with activity detection, scheduling, and other advanced features, see the [Auto Sleep configuration documentation](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sleep.mdx).

## Wake up a vCluster

You can wake up a manually sleeping virtual cluster with two different `vCluster` CLI commands.

As soon as the virtual cluster is woken up, `vCluster` scales up any paused StatefulSets or Deployments and the `vCluster` syncer recreates the `vCluster` pods onto the host cluster.

### Direct wake up

Wake up the virtual cluster explicitly with a `vCluster` CLI command:

```bash title="Wake up a virtual cluster"
vcluster platform wakeup my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```

### Connect to wake up

Connect to the virtual cluster with a `vCluster` CLI command, which automatically wakes up the virtual cluster if it's sleeping:

```bash title="Connect to wake up a virtual cluster"
vcluster connect my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```

## When to use manual vs auto sleep

Choose the approach that best fits your use case:

**Use manual sleep** when:
- You want simple, on-demand control over when clusters sleep
- You don't need automatic activity detection or scheduling
- You're using the free version of vCluster
- You prefer explicit control over sleep and wake operations

**Use auto sleep** when:
- You want clusters to sleep automatically based on inactivity
- You need scheduled sleep and wake operations (for example, weekends or off-hours)
- You want activity detection to automatically wake clusters when needed
- You want to integrate with platform features like auto-deletion
- You need advanced configuration options for resource exemptions and request filtering

For auto sleep configuration, see the [Auto Sleep configuration documentation](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sleep.mdx).
