There is multiple ways how to backup and restore a virtual cluster. vCluster provides a way to create a vCluster snapshot and restore the snapshot via its own CLI.

:::warning
If you are using an external database like MySQL or Postgresql that is **not** running inside the same namespace as vCluster, you need to create a separate backup for the datastore as well. Please refer to the appropriate docs for doing that.
:::

## Using vCluster CLI

:::info
This method requires vCluster version v0.24.0 or higher
:::

The easiest and recommended way to backup the etcd datastore of a vCluster is through the CLI. You can save the snapshot to either: a local file inside the vCluster PVC (or another PVC), an OCI image registry (e.g. docker hub or ghcr.io) or an s3 compatible bucket (e.g. AWS S3 or minio).

:::info
Currently the vCluster CLI backup method does not support backing up persistent volumes. If you require that please take a look at the velero backup method below.
:::

### Create a snapshot

Creating a snapshot can be done via the following command:
```bash
# create an OCI snapshot (use local credentials)
vcluster snapshot my-vcluster oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag

# create an OCI snapshot and mount an external image pull secret
vcluster snapshot my-vcluster oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag --pod-image-pull-secret=my-image-pull-secret --oci-skip-client-credentials

# create an s3 snapshot
vcluster snapshot my-vcluster s3://my-s3-bucket/my-snapshot-key

# create a snapshot to local vCluster pvc (if using embedded storage)
vcluster snapshot my-vcluster file:///data/my-snapshot.tar.gz

# create a snapshot to another pvc (needs to be in the same namespace as vCluster)
vcluster snapshot my-vcluster file:///my-pvc/my-snapshot.tar.gz --pod-mount pvc:my-pvc:/my-pvc
```

Using this command creates a new pod (with the same image as vCluster) that backups the used backing store. To not launch a separate pod and use exec instead you can specify the flag `--pod-exec`.

### Restore from a snapshot

Restoring from a snapshot **stops the vCluster and recreate all vCluster workload pods**. This might cause temporary downtime as long as the restore takes place.

You can restore a vCluster via the following command:
```bash
# restore from an OCI snapshot (use local credentials)
vcluster restore my-vcluster oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag

# restore from an s3 snapshot
vcluster restore my-vcluster s3://my-s3-bucket/my-snapshot-key

# restore from a local pvc snapshot (if using embedded storage)
vcluster restore my-vcluster file:///data/my-snapshot.tar.gz
```

When creating a new vCluster, you can also create the vCluster from a snapshot via:
```bash
# restore from an OCI snapshot (use local credentials)
vcluster create my-vcluster --restore oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag

# migrate an existing vCluster by restoring from a snapshot and applying a new vcluster.yaml
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f vcluster.yaml --restore oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag
```

:::tip
Creating a vCluster from a snapshot can also be an effective method to clone or migrate a vCluster

## Using Velero

You can use [velero](https://velero.io/) to backup virtual clusters. Other backup solutions should usually work as well.

Make sure your cluster supports [volume snapshots](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) to allow velero to backup persistent volumes and persistent volume claims that save the virtual cluster state. Alternatively, you can use [velero's restic integration](https://velero.io/docs/main/restic/) to backup the virtual cluster state.

### Backing up a vCluster

Make sure to install the [velero cli](https://velero.io/docs/main/basic-install/), [velero server components](https://velero.io/docs/v1.8/supported-providers/) and run the following command:
```
velero backup create <backup-name> --include-namespaces=my-vcluster-namespace
```

Verify backup was created successfully with:
```
velero backup describe <backup-name>
```

This should create a similar output to:
```
Name:         <backup-name>
Namespace:    velero
Labels:       velero.io/storage-location=default
Annotations:  velero.io/source-cluster-k8s-gitversion=v1.24.0
              velero.io/source-cluster-k8s-major-version=1
              velero.io/source-cluster-k8s-minor-version=24

Phase:  Completed

Errors:    0
Warnings:  0

Namespaces:
  Included:  test
  Excluded:  <none>

Resources:
  Included:        *
  Excluded:        <none>
  Cluster-scoped:  auto

...
```

### Restoring a vCluster

After you have created a backup through either the velero cli or a schedule, you can restore a vCluster from the created backup via the velero cli:
```
velero restore create <restore-name> --from-backup <backup-name>
```

Verify the restore process via:
```
velero restore logs <restore-name>
```

This should recreate the vCluster workloads, configurations as well as vCluster state in the virtual cluster namespace.

:::warning Moving vClusters
Currently its quite difficult to move a vCluster from one namespace to another as there are objects that include a namespace reference such as the cluster role bindings or persistent volumes. velero supports namespace mapping that should work in most cases, but caution is still required as this might not work for every vCluster setup.
:::

## Using velero inside vCluster

To use velero for making backups you need to enable the [hostpath-mapper](/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/host-path-mapper) component of vCluster.

If hostpath-mapper is installed, you need to install velero cli as explained above and then connect to your vCluster, and install velero:
```
velero install --provider <provider> --bucket <bucket_name>  --secret-file <your_secret_file> --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-<provider>:<semver> --use-restic
```
> Make sure to fill up the appropriate fields like `provider`, `bucket_name`, `secret-file` etc. depending on your installation.

Once the installation is complete you can check the status of the velero resources:
```
$ kubectl get all -n velero
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/restic-5szkb              1/1     Running   0          118s
pod/velero-75c5479dfd-4x7sl   1/1     Running   0          118s

NAME                    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
daemonset.apps/restic   1         1         1       1            1           <none>          118s

NAME                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/velero   1/1     1            1           119s

NAME                                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/velero-75c5479dfd   1         1         1       119s
```

Now you're ready to create a backup using `restic`:
```
velero backup create test1 --default-volumes-to-restic
```

Wait for the backup to complete and eventually you should see the following:
```
$ velero backup describe test1
Name:         test1
Namespace:    velero
Labels:       velero.io/storage-location=default
Annotations:  velero.io/source-cluster-k8s-gitversion=v1.25.0+k3s1
              velero.io/source-cluster-k8s-major-version=1
              velero.io/source-cluster-k8s-minor-version=25
