vCluster snapshots enable you to create volume snapshots for PersistentVolumeClaims that are provisioned by CSI drivers. This allows you to protect not only your virtual cluster resources and config, but also your application data.

See [how volume snapshots are created](../../understand/volume-snapshots) if you would like to learn more about volume snapshots and how vCluster creates them.

:::important
Volume snapshots can be created only for PVCs that are provisioned by CSI drivers with [Volume Snapshots](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) support.

## Setup

In order to create volume snapshots, several installation and configuration steps have to be done in your host or virtual cluster.

### Shared host nodes

The following setup has to be done in the host cluster:
1. Install the [Kubernetes CSI snapshotter](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter) and VolumeSnapshot, VolumeSnapshotContent and VolumeSnapshotClass CRDs. You can find further instructions in the upstream repo.
2. Install a CSI driver that supports volume snapshots, and storage classes for that CSI driver.
3. Configure the default VolumeSnapshotClass for each CSI driver in the host cluster. See [Kubernetes Volume Snapshot Classes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshot-classes/) for more details.

### Private nodes

Create virtual cluster with `deploy.volumeSnapshotController.enabled` config set to `true`. With this config, vCluster installs the common snapshot-controller, and VolumeSnapshot, VolumeSnapshotContent and VolumeSnapshotClass CRDs in your virtual cluster.

The following setup has to be done in the virtual cluster:
1. Install CSI driver with volume snapshots support, and storage classes for that CSI driver.
2. Configure the default VolumeSnapshotClass for each CSI driver in the host cluster. See [Kubernetes Volume Snapshot Classes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshot-classes/) for more details.


## Create snapshot with volumes

You can create a vCluster snapshot, with volume snapshots included, by using the `--include-volumes` param. vCluster CLI creates a snapshot request in the host cluster, which is then processed in the background by the vCluster snapshot controller, which will create volume snapshots.

Here is an example:

```
vcluster snapshot create myvcluster "container:///data/my-snapshot.tar.gz" --include-volumes
13:52:09 info Beginning snapshot creation... You can check the snapshot creation progress with the following command: vcluster snapshot get myvcluster "container:///data/my-snapshot.tar.gz"'
```

You can check the snapshot creation progress with the following command:

```bash
vcluster snapshot get myvcluster "container:///data/my-snapshot.tar.gz"

                  SNAPSHOT               |  STATUS   | AGE
  ---------------------------------------+-----------+------
    container:///data/my-snapshot.tar.gz | Completed | 28s

```

## Limitations

When taking volume snapshots, there are limitations:
- Volume snapshots cannot be created for PVCs that are not provisioned by CSI drivers with [Volume Snapshots](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) support.
- Volume snapshots cannot be created for PVCs that are provisioned by CSI drivers that don't support [Volume Snapshots](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/).
- When using shared host nodes:
  - Currently volume snapshots are created only for PersistentVolumeClaims that are synced to the vCluster host namespace. This means that, when multi-namespace mode is enabled, volume snapshots are not created for the PersistentVolumeClaims that are synced to namespaces different than the vCluster host namespace.
- When using private nodes:
  - vCluster has to be deployed with `deploy.volumeSnapshotController.enabled` config set to `true`.
  - CSI driver with volume snapshots support has to be installed in the virtual cluster.
  - The default VolumeSnapshotClass has to be configured for each CSI driver in the virtual cluster. See [Kubernetes Volume Snapshot Classes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshot-classes/) for more details.
- Volume snapshots are currently not supported for vCluster standalone.
- For vCluster with multi-namespace mode enabled, volume snapshots are created only for PVCs that are synced to vCluster namespace in the host cluster.
