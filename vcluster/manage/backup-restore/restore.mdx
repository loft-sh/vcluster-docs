There are multiple ways to back up and restore a virtual cluster. vCluster provides a built-in method to create and restore snapshots using its CLI.

:::warning
If you use an external database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, that does **not** run in the same namespace as vCluster, you must restore based on the relevant database documentation.  
:::

A vCluster snapshot includes:

- Backing store data (for example, etcd or SQLite)
- vCluster Helm release information
- vCluster configuration (for example, `vcluster.yaml`)

## Restore existing virtual cluster from a snapshot

Restoring from a snapshot pauses the vCluster, scales down all workload pods to 0, and launches a temporary restore pod. Once the restore completes, the vCluster resumes, and all workload pods are scaled back up. This process results in temporary downtime while the restore is in progress.

:::warning Failed Restore 
If the restore fails while using `vcluster restore` commands, the process stops. You must retry the restore to avoid leaving the virtual cluster in an inconsistent or broken state.
:::

Restore a vCluster using the following commands. You can use any snapshot option and set the snapshot URL with different credentials.

```bash title="Restore virtual clusters from OCI, S3, or container snapshots"
# Restore from an OCI snapshot using local credentials.
vcluster restore my-vcluster "oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag"

# Restore from an OCI snapshot while passing in credentials in the snapshot URL
export OCI_USERNAME=my-username
export OCI_PASSWORD=$(echo -n "my-password" | base64)
vcluster restore my-vcluster "oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag?username=$OCI_USERNAME&password=$OCI_PASSWORD&skip-client-credentials=true"

# Restore from an s3 snapshot using local credentials.
vcluster restore my-vcluster "s3://my-s3-bucket/my-snapshot-key"

# Restore from a local pvc snapshot (if using embedded storage).
vcluster restore my-vcluster "container:///data/my-snapshot.tar.gz"
```

## Clone a virtual cluster to a new virtual cluster

You can use snapshots to clone an existing virtual cluster and create a new virtual cluster from that snapshot. When creating a new virtual cluster from a snapshot, it also restores all workloads in the virtual cluster.

:::warning Restore Failures
If the restore failes while using `vcluster create`, the new virtual cluster is automatically deleted.
:::

```bash title="Create a new virtual cluster from an OCI snapshot"
# Create a new virtual cluster from an OCI snapshot (uses local credentials).
vcluster create my-vcluster --restore oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag
```

:::info New name or namespace updates certificates
vCluster certificates change when you create the virtual cluster with a new name or in a new namespace, which is expected as virtual clusters shouldn't share the same certificates.
:::

## Migrate and override vCluster configuration options to create a new vCluster 

When upgrading virtual clusters, there are a couple of configuration options that are not supported to change on an existing virtual cluster. For example, backing store and distro cannot be changed. In order to change these configuration options, you can migrate the virtual cluster by creating a new virtual cluster from a snapshot and applying new configuration options.

When creating a new virtual cluster from a snapshot, it also restores all workloads in the virtual cluster. 

:::warning Restore failures
If the restore fails while using `vcluster create`, the new virtual cluster is automatically deleted.
:::

```bash title="Migrate a virtual cluster by restoring from a snapshot"
# Upgrade an existing vCluster by restoring from a snapshot and applying a new vcluster.yaml.
# Configuration options in the vcluster.yaml override the options from the snapshot.
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f vcluster.yaml --restore oci://ghcr.io/my-user/my-repo:my-tag
```

:::info New name or namespace updates certificates
vCluster certificates change when you create a virtual cluster with a new name or in a different namespace. This behavior is expected, as virtual clusters should not share the same certificates.
:::

### Supported migration options

vCluster supports migration paths based on your setup. The following are the available migration options for Kubernetes distributions and backing stores.

#### Distros

Migrate between Kubernetes distributions based on your workload requirements. You can migrate betweeen the following distros:

- k3s -> k8s
- k8s -> k3s

#### Backing store

Change your data store to improve efficiency, scalability, and Kubernetes compatibility. You can migrate betweeen the following data stores:

- Embedded database (SQLite) -> Embedded database (etcd)
- Embedded database (SQLite) -> External database

All other configuration options are overridden, similar to upgrading a virtual cluster and applying changes.

### Limitations

When taking snapshots and restoring virtual clusters, there are limitations: 

**Virtual clusters with PVs or PVCs**
- Snapshots do not include persistent volumes (PVs) or persistent volume claims (PVCs).

**Sleeping virtual clusters**
- Snapshots require a running vCluster control plane and do not work with sleeping virtual clusters.

**Virtual clusters using the k0s distro**
- Use the `--pod-exec` flag to take a snapshot of a k0s virtual cluster.
- k0s virtual clusters do not support restore or clone operations. Migrate them to k8s instead.

**Virtual clusters using an external database**
- Virtual clusters with an external database handle backup and restore outside of vCluster. A database administrator must back up or restore the external database according to the database documentation. Avoid using the vCluster CLI backup and restore commands for clusters with an external database.
