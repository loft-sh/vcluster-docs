# Test False Positive: Content Modification Only

This file exists to test content-only changes.
When you modify ONLY the content of this file (without renaming it),
it should NOT trigger rename detection.

## Purpose
Testing that `--diff-filter=R` does NOT detect content modifications as renames.

## Expected Result
- Git status: `M` (Modified) only
- Rename detection: Empty (no rename detected)
- Workflow: Should NOT trigger redirect automation

## Instructions
To test: Edit this file's content, commit, and verify no rename is detected.
