This documents the use of the External Secret Operator (ESO) plugin for vCluster.
This plugin allows you to mutualise the host cluster's external secret operator, and seamlessly use existing stores inside virtual clusters.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:
- Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) installed and configured
- Helm 3.x installed
- Access to two Kubernetes clusters (one for the control plane and one for the workloads), with ESO installed
- Basic familiarity with Kubernetes concepts like namespaces, contexts, and YAML configurations

## Part 1: Deploy ESO on the host cluster.

To install ESO on your kubernetes cluster, you can run

```shell
helm repo add external-secrets https://charts.external-secrets.io

helm install external-secrets \
   external-secrets/external-secrets \
    -n external-secrets \
    --create-namespace
```

or follow the steps from ESO documentation [here](https://external-secrets.io/latest/introduction/getting-started/)

## Part 2: Create your virtual cluster using the ESO plugin
Once the operator is installed, you can create a virtual cluster using the following `vcluster.yaml` file.

```yaml
plugins:
  eso:
   image: ghcr.io/loft-sh/eso-plugin
   rbac:
     role:
       extraRules:
         - apiGroups: ["external-secrets.io"]
           resources: ["*"]
           verbs: ["create", "delete", "patch", "update", "get", "list", "watch"]
     clusterRole:
       extraRules:
         - apiGroups: ["apiextensions.k8s.io"]
           resources: ["customresourcedefinitions"]
           verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
         - apiGroups: ["external-secrets.io"]
           resources: ["clustersecretstores"]
           verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
# Make sure the cluster role is enabled or otherwise the plugin won't be able to watch custom
# resource definitions.
rbac:
  clusterRole:
    enabled: true
```

and then run `vcluster create my-vcluster -f vcluster.yaml`

## Part 3: Configuration

Once your virtual cluster is up and running, the plugin should have installed the relevant CRDs, and synchronized ClusterSecretStores into your virtual cluster.

To add namespaced SecretStores into your virtual cluster, you will have to chose whether you want them to be converted into ClusterSecretStores inside the virtual cluster, or put into specific namespaces. To add a namespaced store as a ClusterSecretStore, just add the following annotation to it `loft.sh/convert-to-cluster-store: <name>`. To add it to multiple namespaces as namespaced stores, add the following annotation `loft.sh/to-namespaces: <namespace-1>,<namespace-2>`, the value of the annotation being a comma separated list of destination namespaces. The two annotations are mutually exclusive, and the cluster store annotation will have precedence over namespaced one.
