vCluster is an open-source solution that enables teams to run virtual Kubernetes clusters inside existing infrastructure. It helps platform engineers create secure, isolated environments for development, testing, CI/CD, and even production workloads, without the cost or overhead of managing separate physical clusters.

vCluster supports a wide range of tenancy models, from lightweight namespace-based setups to more advanced configurations with private nodes, GPUs, and bare metal. Environments are defined declaratively, allowing teams to provision repeatable clusters that match their isolation and performance needs.

By consolidating workloads onto fewer host clusters, vCluster reduces infrastructure sprawl, lowers Kubernetes costs, and simplifies multi-tenant platform operations.

## What is a virtual cluster?

A <GlossaryTerm term="virtual-cluster">virtual clusters</GlossaryTerm> is a fully functional Kubernetes cluster that runs on top of another Kubernetes cluster.

Typically, a virtual cluster runs inside a namespace of a <GlossaryTerm term="host-cluster">host cluster</GlossaryTerm>, but it operates as an independent environment, with its own API server, control plane, and resource set.

Depending on the tenancy model, virtual clusters may share or isolate compute and networking resources. Regardless of the underlying setup, they remain abstracted from the host cluster’s global state, enabling strong workload separation and tenant autonomy.

vCluster extends this concept to support a full spectrum of tenancy models, from simple namespace syncing to advanced configurations using shared nodes, virtual nodes, dedicated nodes, or even private nodes.

Virtual clusters are Certified Kubernetes Distributions, adhering to upstream Kubernetes standards while maintaining isolation from the host cluster.

This flexibility allows you to select the ideal tenancy model for your team’s security, cost, and performance requirements, while also benefiting from faster provisioning and centralized management.

## Overview Tenancy Models 

vCluster supports a range of tenancy models, allowing you to choose the right balance of isolation, cost-efficiency, and operational complexity for your platform.
Each virtual cluster runs on top of a host Kubernetes cluster, but how it isolates workloads, consumes resources, and interacts with the underlying infrastructure depends on the tenancy model you select.

Below are the core tenancy models supported by vCluster:


### Namespace Syncing
Run a virtual control plane that syncs to a single namespace.

### Shared Nodes
Schedule workloads onto shared infrastructure across multiple virtual clusters.

### Virtual Nodes
Expose virtual nodes for tenant scheduling without isolating the underlying hardware.

### Dedicated Nodes
Bind virtual cluster workloads to dedicated node pools.

### Private Nodes
Isolate both the control plane and workloads from the host cluster.
