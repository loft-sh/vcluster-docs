import BackingStore from '@site/docs/_partials/config/controlPlane/backingStore.mdx'


Each distro requires a backing store, which can be a database or [etcd](https://etcd.io/). Use a database when you want a lightweight backing store for smaller clusters that do not require high availability. Alternately,  use etcd when you need high availability

vCluster is deployed using a StatefulSet (set of pod replicas + persistent volume (disk)) instead of a deployment (set of pod replicas).
