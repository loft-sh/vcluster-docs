<ProAdmonition/>

etcd is deployed with vCluster to reduce the overall footprint while still providing the advantages of etcd.

You can migrate from an external etcd instance to the embedded one by configuring `migrateFromDeployedEtcd: true`.

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      embedded:
        ...
```
