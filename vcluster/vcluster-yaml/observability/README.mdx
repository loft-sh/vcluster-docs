## Monitoring

You can monitor your virtual cluster either from the host cluster or from within the virtual cluster.

vCluster is able to rewrite node stats and metrics. This means monitoring a virtual cluster works similar to [monitoring a regular Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-usage-monitoring/).

By default, vCluster creates a service for each node that redirects incoming traffic from within the virtual cluster to the node kubelet to vCluster itself. This means that traffic reaches vCluster first if workloads within the virtual cluster try to scrape node metrics. vCluster redirects the incoming request to the host cluster and rewrites the response (pod names, pod namespaces etc) and returns it to the requester.

:::note
vCluster needs RBAC permissions to access host Node metrics from within the virtual cluster. You enable these permissions when you enable real nodes synchronization.
:::

{/*
- The needed role to scrape metrics are added automatically by the Helm chart.
  - node metrics permissions are added [here](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/blob/main/chart/templates/clusterrole.yaml#L83-L85)
  - pod metrics permissions are added [here](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/blob/main/chart/templates/role.yaml#L51-L53)


- The note about service account & `Authorization` header here is if a user wants to scrape metrics using their own client or a different deployment
  - very general steps are (if needed):
    - create a role with the permissions above
    - crete a service account
    - bind the service account to the role with a role binding
    - create a pod that uses the service account by setting `spec.serviceAccount`
    - read the token from `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`
    - finally add the `Authorization` header with the token value

### Virtual cluster workloads

{/*
- See original docs here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/o11y/metrics/metrics_server
- Also see this page: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/o11y/metrics/metrics_server_proxy
- As mentioned, you can get metrics either from the vcluster or the host
  - These proxied metrics endpoints give a vCluster scoped view of the metrics (pods metrics will have the vCluster's pod name, etc)
  - This information is available from the host as well, but will have the synced name of the pods as when viewed from the host
*/}
You have the following monitoring options:

- Proxy the metrics server in the host cluster to the virtual cluster by configuring `observability.metrics.proxy`.
- Install a [metrics server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server#installation) in the virtual cluster. 

### vCluster control plane

{/*
- See original docs here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/o11y/metrics/monitoring_vcluster#monitoring-the-vcluster-statefulset
- These are metrics exposed by the control plane distribution (k3s, k8s, k0s), but should be standardized as described in [Metrics for Kubernetes System Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics/)
  - These metrics are likely enabled by default, but it will depend on the distribution
- This is not related to the `observability.metrics` settings described below, so I'm not sure if these details belong here.
*/}

vCluster exposes the following metrics endpoints:

* vCluster syncer metrics: `https://0.0.0.0:8443/metrics`
* Kubernetes metrics: `https://0.0.0.0:6444/metrics`

To scrape those metrics, send an `Authorization` header with a valid virtual cluster ServiceAccount token that has permissions to access the `/metrics` endpoint within the virtual cluster.

### vCluster Platform

Use the vCluster Platform UI to configure monitoring. See these guides:

- [Metrics and Monitoring](/platform/admin/guides/metrics.mdx)
- [Aggregating Metrics](/platform/guides/aggregating-metrics.mdx)

{/*
- I believe this is covered by the existing docs here: https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/guides/aggregating-metrics -> this is for the UI
- This is not related to the `observability.metrics` settings described below.
- [Metrics Guide](/docs/platform/admin/guides/metrics#metrics)

@TODO I have no idea what to do with this section. From what I can see, users configure monitoring from the UI
