:::note
This feature requires a metrics server installation on the host cluster.
:::

You can proxy the metrics server in the underlying host cluster and get the `pod`/`node` metrics individually or both of them according to the use case. 

`observability.metrics.proxy.nodes`:
- Grants the needed role to access host Node metrics.
- Creates a proxy service that translates metrics responses from the host's metrics server installation.

`observability.metrics.proxy.pods`:
- Grants the needed role to access host Pod metrics.
- Creates a proxy service that translates metrics responses from the host's metrics server installation.
