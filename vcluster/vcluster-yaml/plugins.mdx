:::warning Don't install untrusted plugins
A plugin runs with the same permissions as vCluster itself does in the Kubernetes cluster. Plugins can also define additional permissions, so make sure you only install plugins you trust.

  - structure changed from an array (`plugin`) to a map (`plugins`).
  - This allows a better user experience if they want to put each plugin configuration in separate files. Array merging in Helm typically overrides the entire array value.
  - example: using these args with the array format `-f plugin1.yaml -f plugin2.yaml` would result in the `plugin` array of `plugin2.yaml` getting used
  - using the same args with the `plugins` map format will merge all plugins together when they have different names
- Here's a number of links for people that want to write their own operator: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/#writing-operator
  - Due to vCluster using [go-plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin) as its integration, not all of those links will be compatible. An image containing a single binary is best.
  - The [vcluster-sdk](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-sdk) is likely the best starting point for users wanting to implement a plugin
  - [development tutorial](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/advanced-topics/plugins-development)
- Most of the other settings are for the init container from which the plugin is copied
  - This is important to call out, since `plugin[*].resources` will not change the syncer's resource requests
  - Users will need to adjust `controlePlane.statefulSet.resources` to ensure the deployment has enough CPU / Memory to also run the plugin binary
  - `plugin[*].config` winds up in an environment variable `PLUGIN_CONFIG` that is read by the plugin, and has no specific format.

Most of the settings are for the init container from which vCluster copies the plugin. Adjust `controlPlane.statefulSet.resources` [configuration](/vcluster/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/deployment/statefulset.mdx) to ensure the vCluster deployment has enough CPU  and memory to also run the plugin.

:::note
- `plugins[*].resources` does not change the syncer's resource requests.
- `plugins[*].config` content ends up in an environment variable `PLUGIN_CONFIG` that is read by the plugin. This configuration has no specific format.
