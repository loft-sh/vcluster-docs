import Endpoints from '@site/docs/_partials/config/sync/toHost/endpoints.mdx'

{/*
`services.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
*/}

By default, this is enabled. 

Sync all [Endpoint](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#endpoints) resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. Service resources are also enabled by default and require Endpoint resources.

### Disable syncing Endpoints from the virtual to host cluster

```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    endpoints:
      enabled: false
```
