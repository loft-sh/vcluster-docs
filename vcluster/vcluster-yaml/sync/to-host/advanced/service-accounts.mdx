By default, this is disabled. 

Sync [ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/) resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. 

This is useful for using [AWS IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) with the virtual cluster. In this scenario, the host cluster is defined as the identity provider to access your OIDC-compatible system, which means you don't have to configure each virtual cluster as a provider. vCluster creates a host cluster ServiceAccount token for your synchronized ServiceAccount from the virtual cluster. 

### Sync ServiceAccounts from the virtual to host cluster

```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    serviceAccounts:
      enabled: true
```
