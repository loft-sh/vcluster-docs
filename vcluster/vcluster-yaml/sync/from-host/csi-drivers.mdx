`csiDrivers.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- Added as part of this issue: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/773
- tl;dr: syncing these from the host helps the virtual cluster scheduler make decisions about which node to schedule pods to.
*/}


Sync [CSIDriver](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/) resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. Use this in conjunction with the virtual scheduler inside of vCluster for more advanced scheduling needs. Syncing the CSIDriver resources from the host helps the virtual scheduler make decisions about which node to schedule pods to.

## Default value

Default: `enabled: auto`. 

<DefaultNote/>

## Sync CSIDrivers from the host to virtual cluster

Configure `enabled: true` if you aren't using the virtual schedular but want to sync CSIDriver resources.


```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    csiDrivers:
      enabled: true
```

## Config reference

<EnableSwitch/>
