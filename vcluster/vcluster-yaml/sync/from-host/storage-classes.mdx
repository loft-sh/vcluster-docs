import EnableSwitch from '@site/docs/_partials/config/sync/fromHost/storageClasses.mdx'

By default, this is disabled. 

vCluster does not sync storage classes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. While it's not strictly required when you're syncing PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim resources, syncing StorageClass resources may be required for informational purposes or ensuring that storage is handled consistently between the host and virtual clusters.


{/*
`storageClasses.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- more context behind this config: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/pull/378
- looks like this is a rare resource that is scheduled both from and to the host cluster
  - my understanding is that you can simply use the host cluster's storage classes by default, and the from host syncing is for referenctial integrity
  - if one needs to customize the storage used by vCluster persistent volumes, this would be a reason to define a storage class in the vCluster that then gets synced to the host
  - may want to verify this assessment with Rohan / Fabian

### Sync StorageClasses from the host to virtual cluster

```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    storageClasses:
      enabled: true
```
