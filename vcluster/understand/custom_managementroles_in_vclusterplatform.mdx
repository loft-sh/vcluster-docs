## Overview

This guide explains Management and Custom roles in vCluster and how to create custom management roles for projects.

## 1. What are Management Roles in the vCluster Platform?

Management roles in vCluster can be either **Cluster Roles** or **Platform Roles**, depending on the permissions granted. These roles allow users or teams to manage permissions for their vCluster Platform instance.

Management roles are based on **ClusterRoleTemplate** objects, which act as lightweight wrappers around standard Kubernetes **ClusterRole** objects. These templates are deployed as ClusterRoles to each connected cluster within the vCluster Platform, ensuring consistent permission management.

### **Key Features:**
- Serve as template blueprints for ClusterRoles.
- Provide permissions to Loft's **Management API**.
- Ensure role consistency across all clusters.

## 2. Accessing Management Roles in the vCluster Platform

To access **Management Roles**, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the vCluster platform UI.
2. Navigate to the **Users** section.
3. Click the **Management Roles** tab.

## Custom roles in the platform

Similar to management roles,  Custom Roles in the vCluster platform provide more granular control over permissions for Projects and vClusters. While default management roles offer broad access, custom roles allow organizations to tailor permissions precisely.

### **Why Use Custom Roles?**
- Fine-tuned access control.
- Ensures permissions align with organizational needs.
- Allows role customization for specific users, teams, and applications.

## 4. Steps to Create a Custom Role in the vCluster Platform

To create a custom role, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the vCluster Platform.
2. Navigate to **Users** -> ***Management Roles**.
3. Click **Create Role**.
4. Assign a unique name to the role. Optionally, add a description.
5. To make the role accessible as a project role, add the following label:
   ```yaml
   loft.sh/project-role: 'true'
   ```
6. In **Rules**, define the RBAC policies to be assigned to the role.
7. Click **Save Changes**.

## 5. How to Check if a Custom Role Can Be Assigned to a Project

1. Navigate to **Project Settings**.
2. Under the **Users** section, add a new user.
3. The Roles dropdown now displays the custom role for selection.
