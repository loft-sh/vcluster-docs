title: "vCluster to Host Cluster: Pod Creation Explained"
---

A pod in a vCluster isn't created directly in the host cluster but instead follows a well-defined process. Letâ€™s debunk the myth that users interact directly with the vCluster and explore what happens behind the scenes.

## vCluster Pod Creation

The important components of vCluster that work in pod creation are:

- **Kube-apiserver (host cluster)**
- **Kube-apiserver (vCluster)**
- **Syncer**

## Pod Creation Steps

1. **Pod Creation in vCluster**  
   The creation of a pod in a vCluster is done by making an API call to the vCluster **kube-apiserver**. The API server creates the pod in the vCluster backend storage (etcd or similar).

2. **Role of the Syncer**  
   The **Syncer** is a key component of vCluster that watches for any events from the **kube-apiserver of vCluster** and communicates with the **kube-apiserver of the host cluster** to sync the action. In this case, the action is the **creation of the pod in the host cluster**. The host cluster then proceeds with its usual job of bringing the pod up and setting its state to `ready`, just as it would for any other pod.

2. **Host Cluster Handling**  
   The host cluster continues with its routine process of bringing the pod up and setting its state to `ready`, ensuring that it behaves like any other pod in the cluster.

3. **Pod Status Synchronization**  
   Once the pod reaches `state=ready`, the **Syncer** copies the pod's status from the host cluster and applies it to the pod created in the vCluster namespace.
