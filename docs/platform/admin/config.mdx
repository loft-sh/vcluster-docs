The vCluster Platform config allows you to modify vCluster Platform's behaviour and enable or disable certain features, such as SSO login, custom branding, or auditing.

## Changing vCluster Platform Config

vCluster Platform config can be applied directly via helm values or through the vCluster Platform UI in `Admin` > `Config`. Using helm values allows you to declaratively deploy vCluster Platform.

When using helm you can apply the vCluster Platform config via a `vcluster.yaml` file. This also makes it possible to deploy vCluster Platform through GitOps solutions such as ArgoCD. An example vCluster Platform `vcluster.yaml` could look like this:

```yaml
config:
  loftHost: my-vcluster-host.com
  audit:
    enabled: true
  auth:
    github:
      clientId: $CLIENT_ID
      clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
      redirectURI: https://my-vcluster-host.com/auth/github/callback
```

For a complete overview what helm values are possible, please take a look at the [Loft github repository](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart) directly.

### Changing the Loft Host variable

After setting up the platform and TLS certificates and configuring the ingress to use a custom domain, one should change the `loftHost` variable shown above.
Initially, that value will be set to the URL of either the Loft Router domain or no domain in the case of air-gapped setups.
This value should be equal to the hostname specified in the ingress resource for accessing the platform.

:::info
This value of the `loftHost` variable should only be the hostname that vCluster Platform Platform is reachable at and not contain protocols (such as HTTP) or subpaths.
:::

After changing the `loftHost`, all currently connected clusters must be redeployed by running the same connection commands in the corresponding Kubernetes context.
See the instructions [on connecting Clusters](../clusters/connect-cluster) for more guidance.

Clusters will also have to be reconnected if the `additionalCA` or `insecureSkipVerify` values are changed after the initial setup.

### Sensitive Information in the vCluster Platform Config

Some fields within the vCluster Platform config allow placeholders for environment variables, such as the `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields. This makes it possible to not expose the sensitive information directly inside the vCluster Platform values and instead mount this information into vCluster Platform through an external secret.

To load the github clientId and clientSecret through a Kubernetes secret `my-secret`, use the following configuration:

```yaml
envValueFrom:
  CLIENT_ID:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: my-secret
      key: client_id
  CLIENT_SECRET:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: my-secret
      key: client_secret

config:
  auth:
    github:
      clientId: $CLIENT_ID
      clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
      redirectURI: https://my-vcluster-pro-host.com/auth/github/callback
```

Then use helm to apply this configuration:

```
helm upgrade loft vcluster-control-plane --install \
  --repo https://charts.vcluster-pro.sh/ \
  --version $VERSION
  --namespace vcluster-pro \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values.yaml
```

:::info
Make sure to replace the $VERSION in the above statement with the vCluster Platform version you are using
:::

### Custom HTTP Headers

vCluster Platform allows you to add custom HTTP headers to all requests that are sent to the vCluster Platform API. This can be useful if you want to add custom headers to all requests, such as `X-Frame-Options` or `X-XSS-Protection`.

To add custom HTTP headers, use the following configuration:

```yaml
config:
  auth:
    customHttpHeaders:
      X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
      X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```
