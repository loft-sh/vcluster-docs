## Air-Gapped / Offline / VPC Clusters

If your cluster is air-gapped, within a VPC or restricts network connectivity in other ways, you
may run into issues validating the vCluster Platform license and pulling vCluster Platform images required for vCluster Platform.

To solve the licensing issue, you can either use allow HTTP requests from the vCluster Platform pod(s) to
`https://admin.loft.sh/*` (this is the preferred option), or use an
[offline license key](#offline-license-key).

To solve not being able ot pull images from Docker hub, you can
[use a private image registry](#offline-images) to host your own copies of the vCluster Platform image that
your cluster can reach.

### Offline Images

If your cluster is not able to pull images from Docker Hub, you have to push the vCluster Platform images
into your private registry. To find out which images are required, we publish a file called
`loft-images.txt` with each vCluster Platform release.

Follow these instructions to download all vCluster Platform and import them to your private registry:

<Flow id="offline-images">
    <Step>
        <PartialAdminSetVersion/>
  </Step>
  <Step>

Set your private registry as variable:

```bash
REGISTRY=ecr.io/myteam      # THIS SHOULD BE A PREFIX / DO NOT INCLUDE ANY LOFT_IMAGE PATHS
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Download the file `loft-images.txt` and the required scripts called `download-images.sh` and `push-images.sh` and make them executable:

```bash
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/loft-images.txt
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/download-images.sh
wget https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/releases/download/v${VERSION}/push-images.sh

chmod +x ./download-images.sh
chmod +x ./push-images.sh
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Run `download-images.sh` to download all images locally:

```bash
./download-images.sh --image-list loft-images.txt
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Run `push-images.sh` to push all downloaded images to your private registry:

```bash
./push-images.sh --registry ${REGISTRY}
```

  </Step>
  <Step>

Edit your existing `vcluster-pro.yaml` file or create a new file named `vcluster-pro.yaml` with content:

```yaml
image: ${REGISTRY}/ghcr.io/loft-sh/loft:${VERSION} # Replace ${REGISTRY} and ${VERSION}
env:
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_REGISTRY: ${REGISTRY} # Replace ${REGISTRY}
```

  </Step>
  <Step>
        <PartialAdminUpgrade/>
    </Step>
</Flow>

### Offline License Key

If your cluster does not allow the vCluster Platform pod to connect the vCluster Platform license server
(`https://admin.loft.sh/*`), you can contact [sales@loft.sh](mailto:sales@loft.sh) to purchase
an offline license key or to request a trial license key for offline use.

You can edit vCluster Platform install values as follows to use your offline license key:

```yaml
env:
  LICENSE_KEY: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
```
