Using vCluster Platform CLI is the preferred way to deploy vCluster Platform to a Kubernetes cluster. If you decide later
on you want to manage your vCluster Platform instance via GitOps, you may export the applied Kubernetes
manifests or Helm chart configuration and store this data in a git repository.

## 1. Download and Install vCluster Platform CLI

Use one of the following commands to download the vCluster Platform CLI binary from GitHub:

<InstallCLIPartial />

## 2. Deploy the vCluster Platform Platform


Make sure you are using the correct host cluster kube-context via `kubectl config current-context` and then run:

:::caution Prerequisites
Please make sure you meet the following requirements
before running this command:
1. Current kube-context has admin access to the cluster
2. Helm v3 must be installed
3. kubectl must be installed
:::

```bash
vcluster pro start
```
This will deploy the vCluster Platform platform into the host `vcluster-pro` namespace, by default, and then establishes a port-forwarding connection.
The UI will automatically open in your browser and log you in. You will be asked for your user details to create the admin user. 

From this point on, you will be able to create virtual clusters using the Pro Distro. 

:::tip Troubleshooting
Your vCluster Platform pod is not starting or the UI is not showing up? View the
[Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.mdx) if you have any
issues.

## 3. Logging in

While `vcluster pro start` logs you in automatically, you can also manually login via the CLI:

```bash
vcluster login https://1rtjxak.loft.host      # See `vcluster pro start` output for login credentials and your actual sub-domain name (auto-generated).
```

This command will open the browser where you can sign in using the login data shown in the
output of `vcluster pro start`.


## 4. Create vClusters

Let's now create a virtual cluster called `my-vcluster-pro` in the `my-vcluster-pro-namespace` namespace, via the vCluster CLI:

```bash
vcluster create my-vcluster-pro --namespace my-vcluster-pro-namespace   
```
This command will create a virtual cluster using the Pro Distro. 
:::caution Pro & OSS vClusters
While logged in to vCluster Platform, all vClusters will be created using the vCluster Platform Distro, unless you add the `--disable-pro` flag to the `create` command. Please note that these OSS vClusters will not show up in the vCluster Platform UI, unless you also import them.
