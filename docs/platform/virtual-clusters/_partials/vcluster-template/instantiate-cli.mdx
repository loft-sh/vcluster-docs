When creating a virtual cluster from the vCluster Platform CLI, you will need to provide the name of the
project in which to deploy the virtual cluster, and the name of template to use:

```bash
vcluster pro create [vcluster-name] --project [project-name] --template [template-name]
```

:::info Kube-Context
Running `vcluster pro create` will automatically add a kube-context to your kube-config file, so you can immediately run `kubectl` commands right after creating a virtual cluster.
