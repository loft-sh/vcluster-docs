## Learning objectives

If you are already "GitOps-ing" all of your applications deployed into your Kubernetes cluster(s),
you may want to do the same with vCluster Platform! This short guide is intended to give you a quick rundown
of the basics of getting vCluster Platform deployed in a GitOps style. Note that there is nothing inherently
"special" or different about vCluster Platform compared to other application, so general GitOps practices
should apply nicely to vCluster Platform! Note that this guide will refer to ArgoCD, however any GitOps
tooling can be used to deploy vCluster Platform, and the general approach should remain the same!

## Basic deployment

Before continuing, you should take a look at the [installation with helm ](/platform/admin/guides/install-with-helm.mdx)
section of the docs. As you may guess from the title, the installation with helm doc section
covers the basics of installing vCluster Platform with Helm! In general, we recommend using Helm for GitOps
deployments as well, so it is worth a few minutes to review the helm installation docs.

The most basic GitOps vCluster Platform deployment would be to simply create a helm based application and
deploy the vCluster Platform chart with any desired values. Below is a simple ArgoCD example of just that:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: loft
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    name: ""
    namespace: vcluster-pro
    server: "https://kubernetes.default.svc"
  source:
    path: ""
    repoURL: "https://charts.loft.sh"
    targetRevision: 3.3.0-beta.4
    chart: vcluster-control-plane
    helm:
      parameters:
        # admin
        - name: admin.create
          value: "true"
        - name: admin.username
          value: admin
        - name: admin.password
          value: password

        # ingress
        - name: ingress.enabled
          value: "true"
        - name: ingress.host
          value: "vcluster-pro.example"
        - name: ingress.name
          value: "loft-ingress"

        # audit
        - name: audit.enableSideCar
          value: "true"
        - name: config.audit.level
          value: "1"

        # config
        - name: config.loftHost
          value: "https://vcluster-pro.example"

  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

The above ArgoCD application would deploy vCluster Platform into the local cluster, in the "loft" namespace.
In this example there are values being passed to set some basic configurations including an
admin user/password, ingress configuration, and some basic audit configuration.

When deploying the vCluster Platform chart as above, the vCluster Platform deployment itself will deploy the vCluster Platform agent
into the local cluster for you. If you would like to manage the agent deployment yourself, see
the subsequent [agent](#agents) section.

At its most basic, that's it!

:::warning ArgoCD and Helm Releases
If you are administering your vCluster Platform instance with ArgoCD you will be unable to update the vCluster Platform
config in the vCluster Platform UI. This should not be an issue as if you are managing vCluster Platform in a GitOps
fashion you are (hopefully) avoiding manual updates like this, but it is important to note! This is
due to ArgoCD not deploying the Helm release secret.
:::

## Connected Clusters

One of the great benefits of vCluster Platform is that you can easily manage resources located in many
physical clusters by adding them to vCluster Platform and using vCluster Platform as your central point of management.
When you add a "connected" cluster to vCluster Platform, vCluster Platform creates a `Cluster` resource and installs a
vCluster Platform Agent in the cluster to handle local reconciliation tasks. If you are managing vCluster Platform via a
GitOps style, you may also wish to manage these connected clusters in a similar fashion (rather
than letting vCluster Platform install and manage the Agent). This section outlines some basics of how to
accomplish this.

## Cluster Resources

If you would like to manage vCluster Platform _and_ vCluster Platform agents via your GitOps tooling, you likely also want
to manage the connected cluster configurations that live inside vCluster Platform. These configuration
elements inform vCluster Platform of the remote connected clusters, and how to connect to those clusters to
validate the agent installation, and to proxy kubernetes commands from the central vCluster Platform instance
to the remote cluster(s).

Each cluster requires two resources, a `Cluster` object that simply defines the cluster name and
the owner of the cluster inside of vCluster Platform, and an associated `Secret` that contains relevant
configuration information for vCluster Platform to connect to the cluster.

A common strategy for bundling cluster data with your primary vCluster Platform Application (as in ArgoCD
Application object) is to write a simple "parent" Helm chart that includes vCluster Platform as a dependency.
This parent chart can contain anything you'd like of course, but in this case would be used to
include the `Cluster`(s) objects and their associated `Secret` objects.

:::warning Cluster Secrets
The secret associated with a Cluster object necessarily includes authentication data to access
the remote cluster -- take care to ensure that this information is handled appropriately!
:::

A simple `Chart.yaml` that includes the base vCluster Platform chart as a dependency may look similar to this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: loft-manager
description: A parent Helm chart for vCluster Platform
type: application
version: 1.0.0
dependencies:
  - name: vcluster-control-plane
    version: 3.3.0-beta.4
    repository: https://charts.loft.sh
```

Values that need to be passed to the dependent vCluster Platform chart can be passed by referring to the
dependency name, in this case, "loft". For example, if you wanted to set the `replicaCount`
value on the vCluster Platform chart, you could do as follows in a values.yaml file:

```yaml
loft:
  replicaCount: 3
```

:::info Who is managing the vCluster Platform agent?!
Remember, if you want to manage the vCluster Platform agent via your GitOps workflow, make sure you set the
`DISABLE_AGENT` environment variable to "true" for your vCluster Platform deployment!
:::

The "parent" Helm chart can now include any additional resources that you may want to deploy
with your vCluster Platform instance -- in this case, the chart should include both the `Cluster` and
`Secret` resources for any connected clusters. You can accomplish this by having a simple
template that iterates over an array of clusters that users can provide via values, something
like the following:

```yaml
{{ range .Values.clusters }}
---
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: {{ .name }}
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
spec:
  access:
  - subresources:
    - '*'
    users:
    - admin
    verbs:
    - '*'
  config:
    secretName: loft-cluster-config-{{ .name }}
    secretNamespace: vcluster-pro
  displayName: {{ .name }}
  owner:
    user: admin
{{ end }}

{{ range .Values.clusters }}
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
  config: {{ .config | b64enc }}
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: loft-cluster-config-{{ .name }}
  namespace: vcluster-pro
type: Opaque
{{ end }}
```

With the above template, users would provide an array of maps containing a "name" and a "config"
field. For example:

```yaml
clusters:
  - name: my-connected-cluster
    config: |
      apiVersion: v1
      clusters:
      - cluster:
          certificate-authority-data: YOUR-CA-DATA-HERE
          server: https://1.2.3.4:6443
        name: my-connected-cluster
      contexts:
      - context:
          cluster: my-connected-cluster
          namespace: kube-system
          user: my-connected-cluster-user
        name: my-connected-cluster-context
      current-context: my-connected-cluster-context
      kind: Config
      preferences: {}
      users:
      - name: my-connected-cluster-user
        user:
          token: YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
```

:::warning Missing CRDs?!
You may have noticed a strange annotation on the `Cluster` resource above --
"argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true". This annotation tells
ArgoCD to skip the dry run/check of the resource. We need this for initial deployments as vCluster Platform
itself will deploy the `Cluster` CRD into the cluster. Without this annotation the Application
will be unable to be synced!
:::

### Agents

If you have disabled agent installation on your vCluster Platform, you will need to ensure
that you are installing the vCluster Platform agent into each connected cluster. Without doing this, vCluster Platform
will not be able to do anything in the connected cluster!

The most obvious difference with managing the agents as compared to the vCluster Platform manager is that the
agents will of course need to be installed in the connected ("remote", as in non-local to vCluster Platform
manager) cluster(s). Assuming you have successfully added the relevant cluster(s) as available
clusters in your ArgoCD configuration, you can simply create another ArgoCD Application to
manage the agent. The following is a basic example of this:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: loft-agent-my-other-cluster
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  destination:
    name: ""
    namespace: vcluster-pro
    server: "https://my-other-cluster:6443"
  source:
    path: ""
    repoURL: "https://charts.loft.sh"
    targetRevision: 3.3.0-beta.4
    chart: vcluster-control-plane
    helm:
      parameters:
        # required parameter
        - name: agentOnly
          value: true

        # custom parameters
        - name: env.SOMEVAR
          value: myvalue

  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

Once again, note that if you want to manage the agent deployments via ArgoCD or your GitOps
tooling of choice, you will want to ensure that the `DISABLE_AGENT` environment variable is set
to "true" for your vCluster Platform deployment!

## Everything Else

Love managing vCluster Platform itself with your GitOps tooling? Want to manage the resources _in_ vCluster Platform with
that same tooling? Great news! You can do just that! One of the core tenets of vCluster Platform is that all
vCluster Platform resources are just "normal" Kubernetes resources. This means that you can manage any vCluster Platform
objects in the same way you'd manage any other Kubernetes resources in your GitOps workflow.

To generate the appropriate manifests to manage each vCluster Platform resource type, you may want to check
out the [API documentation](/platform/api/resources/project/README.mdx) where you can find example manifests and
argument references for nearly all vCluster Platform resource types. Alternatively you can use the vCluster Platform UI to
build out your required objects and simply snag the YAML output from the build pane and use that
as your manifest content.

Here is a small example of creating a `Team`, and a `Project` that the team is a member of. You
could manage teams and projects like this in your GitOps platform, then allow project users to
create resources in vCluster Platform as they wish. This would "GitOps-ify" the core bits and allow teams to
control their own environments in vCluster Platform manually if they wish. The following manifests could be
added into a custom Helm chart, or simply used as manifests in a repo connected to ArgoCD. This
is a contrived example of course, but the main point here is that all vCluster Platform resources are just
"normal" Kubernetes (custom) resources that can be managed with your GitOps tooling, or any
other Kubernetes-centric tooling!

```yaml

apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
