:::caution Resources inside vCluster
Deleting a vCluster instance also deletes all objects within and all states related to the vCluster. If the namespace on the host cluster was created by the vCluster CLI, then that namespace is also deleted.

<TabItem value="cli">
To delete a vCluster using the CLI:

```bash
vcluster delete my-vcluster --namespace team-x
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="helm">
To delete the vCluster deployed with Helm:

```bash
helm delete my-vcluster -n team-x --repository-config=''
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kubectl">
The easiest option to delete a virtual cluster using `kubectl` is to delete the host namespace:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace team-x
```

In case you have multiple vClusters or any other resources in this namespace, you can also just delete the vCluster-related resources:
```bash
kubectl delete -n team-x serviceaccount vcluster-1
kubectl delete -n team-x role vcluster-1
kubectl delete -n team-x rolebinding vcluster-1
kubectl delete -n team-x service vcluster-1
kubectl delete -n team-x service vcluster-1-headless
kubectl delete -n team-x statefulset vcluster-1
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="terraform">
To delete a vCluster managed by Terraform:

1. Remove the vCluster configuration from your Terraform files.
1. Apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```
1. Alternatively, if you want to remove all resources managed by the Terraform configuration in the current workspace:

```bash 
terraform destroy
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="argo">
To delete a vCluster deployed with Argo CD:

```bash 
kubectl delete application my-vcluster -n argocd
```
Argo CD will automatically uninstall the vCluster when the application is deleted and synced again.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cluster-api">
To delete a vCluster managed by the Cluster API:

```bash
kubectl delete vcluster my-vcluster -n team-x
```

</TabItem>
