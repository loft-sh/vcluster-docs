Due to the rapid development of the platform, each minor version receives active support for 6 months after its release. Active support ends on the End of Support (EOS) end date. After the EOS end date, the version enters End of Life (EOL), during which only critical security updates are backported. During active support, updates from the active development branch can be backported upon request.

Any previous versions which are not on the following list, are no longer in any support window.
