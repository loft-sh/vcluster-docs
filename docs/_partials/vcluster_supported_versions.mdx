Due to rapid development, each minor version receives active support for 3 months after its release. Active support ends on the End of Support (EOS) date. After the EOS date, the version enters the End of Support (EOS) period, during which only critical security updates are backported. After the End of Life (EOL) date, the version enters the End of Life (EOL) period, during which no updates are provided. 

During active support, updates from the active development branch can be backported upon request.

Versions not listed under End of Support (EOS) or End of Life (EOL) are considered unsupported.
