## Feature Versioning

While most features we release are fully supported, some are introduced at an earlier stage of development. These stages generally align with [Kubernetes conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages), with the exception of [experimental features](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/next/configure/vcluster-yaml/experimental/) which may be removed at any time.

- **Alpha**: Newly introduced features which may include breaking changes in future releases.

- **Beta**: Features that are more stable and considered safe, but not recommended for business critical applications.
