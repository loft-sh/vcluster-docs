import ExportKubeConfig from '@site/docs/_partials/config/exportKubeConfig.mdx'

Customize how vCluster exports the kubeconfig file to a secret, so you can use it, for example, in your ArgoCD or Terraform pipelines. 

vCluster always creates a kubeconfig in a secret called `vc-NAME` in the namespace where you deployed vCluster. Configure `exportKubeConfig` so vCluster creates an additional secret with the given configuration.

{/*
`--kube-config-context-name` is now the `context` property:
  - https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/554 is the issue where this was requested
  - Configures the context name in the kubeconfig that is written to a secret.
`--out-kube-config-server` is now the `server` property:
  - https://www.vcluster.com/docs/using-vclusters/kube-context#externally-accessible-vclusters
`--out-kube-config-secret-namespace` is now the `secret.namespace` property.
  - It appears in the "Tip" at the bottom of this section: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/using-vclusters/kube-context#retrieving-the-kube-config-from-the-vcluster-secret
`--out-kube-config-secret` is now the `secret.name` property:
  - It did not have a section in the old docs, but has been part of vcluster from the initial commit, and has always been set to `vc-{{ .Release.Name }}` by the helm chart.
  - We may not want people changing this.

| Deprecated Parameter             | Config Field       | Notes |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| `--kube-config-context-name`         | `context`          | You can configure the context name in the kubeconfig.   |
| `--out-kube-config-server`           | `server`           | If you have exposed the virtual cluster, you can instruct vCluster to create the kubeconfig secret with another server endpoint.   |
| `--out-kube-config-secret-namespace` | `secret.namespace` | You can specify a different namespace where vCluster should create the kubeconfig secret. You have to manually apply RBAC permissions for vCluster to allow creation and retrieving of secrets in that namespace.   |
| `--out-kube-config-secret`           | `secret.name`      | You can configure the secret's name, which otherwise uses the `vc-<cluster-name>` pattern.   |

## Example using the same namespace for the secret

In this example:

- You want to call this kubeconfig context `my-domain-context`.
- You have exposed the virtual cluster on `https://my-domain.org` and want the kubeconfig to use that endpoint.
- You named your cluster "my-cluster" but you want the secret's name to reflect the virtual cluster domain name.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-domain-context
  server: https://my-domain.org
  secret:
    name: vc-my-domain
```
{/*

## Example using a new namespace for the secret

In this example:

- You want to call this kubeconfig context `my-domain-context`.
- You have exposed the virtual cluster on `https://my-domain.org` and want the kubeconfig to use that endpoint.
- You created a namespace called `kubeconfig-secret-namespace` for the secret.
- You have acccess to the new namespace by creating a ClusterRole which allows being able to create secrets in the other namespace.
- You named your cluster "my-cluster" but you want the secret's name to reflect the virtual cluster domain name.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-domain-context
  server: https://my-domain.org
  secret:
    namespace: kubeconfig-secret-namespace
    name: vc-my-domain
```
