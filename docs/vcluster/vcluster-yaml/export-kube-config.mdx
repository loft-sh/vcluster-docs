import ExportKubeConfig from '@site/docs/_partials/config/exportKubeConfig.mdx'

This feature exports the kubeconfig file so you can use it, for example, in your ArgoCD or Terraform pipelines.


`--kube-config-context-name` is now the `context` property:
  - https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/554 is the issue where this was requested
  - Configures the context name in the kubeconfig
`--out-kube-config-server` is now the `server` property:
  - https://www.vcluster.com/docs/using-vclusters/kube-context#externally-accessible-vclusters
`--out-kube-config-secret-namespace` is now the `secret.namespace` property.
  - It appears in the "Tip" at the bottom of this section: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/using-vclusters/kube-context#retrieving-the-kube-config-from-the-vcluster-secret
`--out-kube-config-secret` is now the `secret.name` property:
  - It did not have a section in the old docs, but has been part of vcluster from the initial commit, and has always been set to `vc-{{ .Release.Name }}` by the helm chart.
  - We may not want people changing this.
