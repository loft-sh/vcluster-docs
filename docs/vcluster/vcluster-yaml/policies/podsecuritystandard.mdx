`podSecurityStandard`:
- Original vCluster docs: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/pod-security
- Kubernetes docs: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/
- tl;dr: These security standards control pre-built validation of a Pod's capabilities. They don't necessarily grant permissions to a Pod, but rather prevent a Pod from being created that requests more permissions than the standard. Typically this is done through the pods's `spec.securityContext`, but can also cover things like host ports, volume types, and special annotations used for AppArmor profiles.
- Also part of [Isolated Mode](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/isolated-mode)
