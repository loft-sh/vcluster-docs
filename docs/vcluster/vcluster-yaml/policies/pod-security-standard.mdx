[Pod security standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) control pre-built validation of a Pod's capabilities. The security standards don't necessarily grant permissions to a Pod, but rather prevent a Pod from being created that requests more permissions than the standard. Typically this is done through the pods's `spec.securityContext` but can also cover things like host ports, volume types, and special annotations used for Linux AppArmor profiles.
