<NetworkPolicyInfo/>

Policies cover several different topics:
- [limit ranges](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/)
  - The existing docs on [Quotas & Limits](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/quotas-limits) describes these as being configured separately, but they can also be created by configuring them in the vcluster.yaml.
  - These control the storage / CPU / memory that each pod may request
- [resource quotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
  - The existing docs are [Quotas & Limits](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/quotas-limits) describes these as being configured separately, but they can also be created by configuring them in the vcluster.yaml.
- [pod security standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)
  - The existing docs are [Pod Security](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/pod-security)
- [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
  - The existing docs are [Network Isolation](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/network-isolation)
  - Additionally https://www.vcluster.com/docs/networking/network_policies
- [admission webhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#admission-webhooks)
  - The existing docs are [Centralized Admission Control](https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/centralized_admission_control#configuration)
  - The admission controller is typically running on the Host cluster, where the policies enforced by the webhook cannot be changed by the virtual cluster.
  - Users could deploy their own admission webhooks to the virtual cluster, but there's little value in doing so, and this configuration is not concerned with that use case.
  - Some examples of admission controller projects:
    - [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/)
    - [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/)
    - [jsPolicy](https://www.jspolicy.com/)
  - It's common for organizations to develop an in-house collect of policies that can enforce naming standards etc.

These settings can be use separately for specific cases, or together (like in the case of Isolated Mode).

## Isolated Mode
[Isolated Mode](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/isolated-mode) is a predefined set of policies provided for convenience. This is not to be confused with the [Isolated Control Plane](https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/isolated_control_planes) PRO feature.
