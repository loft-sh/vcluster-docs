- Mappings of old syncer flags to the updated yaml:
  - `--target-namespace` -> `experimental.syncSettings.targetNamespace`
  - `--set-owner` -> `experimental.syncSettings.setOwner`
  - `--sync-labels` -> `experimental.syncSettings.syncLabels`
- `syncSettings.disableSync`: as stated, this will skip starting all sync controllers, but also skips deploying CoreDNS
  - almost always used with `syncSettings.rewriteKubernetesService`
  - Previous flag (possibly undocumented) `--noop-syncer=true`
- `syncSettings.rewriteKubernetesService`:
  - used with `syncSettings.disableSync`
  - Previous flag (possibly undocumented) `--sync-k8s-service=true`
  - this was previously referred to as the "no-op syncer"
  - originally implemented for CoreWeave as a pro option: https://linear.app/loft/issue/ENG-1555/vclusterpro-no-op-syncer-for-non-vcluster-use
