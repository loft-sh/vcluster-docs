  - Current implementation differs from what is described in PRO-348
    - Only validation based on matched namespaces, and resource group / kind / version and request verbs are supported
    - certain users can be excluded from validation
    - No mutation of requests, only allow / deny
- looks to have been `checks` previously, configured via environment variable `PROXY_WEBHOOK_CONFIG`
  - I have not been able to find any documentation for usage
  - Old usage found here:
    - [setting PROXY_WEBHOOK_CONFIG](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-pro/blob/65ed57fccbf0851f2e4116cbdaf4c0503eb65db7/devspace_start.sh#L39)
    - [example rules](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-pro/blob/65ed57fccbf0851f2e4116cbdaf4c0503eb65db7/hack/proxy-webhook-config.yaml)
  - New usage would be very similar, but `checks` is now `denyProxyRequests`, and the configuration can be specified in `vcluster.yaml`

Configure denying proxy requests based on rules.

- Only validation based on matched namespaces, and resource group / kind / version and request verbs are supported.
- No mutation of requests, only allow / deny.
