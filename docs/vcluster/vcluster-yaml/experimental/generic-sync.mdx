- The current documentation is hard to follow, since it's organized across multiple headings, which makes it seem like they are unrelated features, but really they are typically used together:
  - configuration syntax: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/other_resources/config_syntax

  - Hooks refer to [Sync Patches](https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/generic_resource_patches), which is a Pro feature
    - not sure how to represent this in the current docs structure, if genericSync is an OSS feature

Make host cluster CRDs and resources available to the virtual cluster for use by workloads.

## Configuration syntax

### Virtual to host cluster

```yaml
experimental:  
  genericSync:
    export:
      - apiVersion:
        kind:
        patches:
          - op:
            path:
        reversePatches:
          - op:
            path:
        selector:
          labelSelector:
```

Use the top-level `export` field to declare which virtual resources you want to sync to the host cluster. Each item in the `export` array defines the resource via `apiVersion` and `kind` strings. Each `apiVersion` and `kind` pair can have only one entry in the `export` array. 

Use `patches` to define how to modify synced resources before the resource's creation or update in the host cluster.   

Use `reversePatches` to declare how changes to synced host cluster resource propogate back to the original resource in the virtual cluster.

Use `selector` to limit which resources to sync from the virtual cluster. The virtual resource is synced when it matches one or more selectors, or when the `selector` field is empty. 

See [Certificate manager](#certificate-manager-export) for an example.

### Host to virtual cluster

```yaml
experimental:
  multiNamespaceMode:
    enabled: true
  genericSync:
    import:
      - apiVersion:
        kind:
        patches:
          - op:
            path:
        reversePatches:
          - op:
            path:
        selector:
          labelSelector:
```

Requires multi-namespace mode.

Use the top-level `import` field to declare which host resources to sync to the virtual cluster. Each item in the `import` array defines the resource via `apiVersion` and `kind` strings. Each `apiVersion` and `kind` pair can have only one entry in the `import` array. 

Use `patches` to define how to modify certain synced resource fields before the resource's creation or update in the virtual cluster. See [patches reference]  for details.  

Use `reversePatches` to declare how changes to synced virtual cluster resource propogate back to the original resource in the host cluster.

Use `selector` to limit which resources to sync from the host cluster. The host resource is synced when it matches, or when the `selector` is empty. 

## Hooks (Pro)

<ProAdmonition/>

Use Hooks to:

- Patch any Kubernetes resource during synchronization and before resources are applied to the Kubernetes API server. 
- Remove sensitive information before being written to the host or virtual cluster. 

You can also add additional information to a resource, such as labels and annotations on all resources belonging to a tenant.

Hooks configuration specifies Kubernetes resources to patch. You can specify the resource group, API version, and resource kind and then the verbs for
which API calls to patch. Configure patches using operations like `add`, `remove`, `replace`, and `copyFromObject`. See [Node info remover](#node-info-remover-hooks-pro) for an example.

## Examples

Find additional configuration examples in the vCluster repository's [generic-sync-examples folder](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/tree/main/generic-sync-examples).

### Certificate manager export

Create TLS certificates for websites and manage your own cert-manager [Issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/). The RBAC-namespaced `role` and cluster-scoped `clusterRole` configure permissions.

The vCluster instance must run in multi-namespace mode so that it can:

- Utilize cert-manager's Issuer resource.
- Sync cert-manager's namespace-scoped Secret to the virtual cluster's namespace, so the virtual cluster's Ingress can use the Secret.

Follow these steps to use cert-manager:

1. Create an Issuer in the virtual cluster.
1. Create an Ingress in the virtual cluster that uses the Issuer through annotation: `cert-manager.io/issuer: ${ISSUER_NAME}`.
1. Verify that a `Certificate` resource has been created for the ingress.
1. Verify that a `Secret` with the name from `spec.tls[0].secretName` has been created and synced back to the vCluster with the generated certificate.
1. Apply the cert-manager configuration. 


{/*
- Use case: Allow users  from [here](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/blob/main/generic-sync-examples/cert-manager))
- Configuring generic sync:
  - Mention that we need to enable multi-namespace mode to utilize cert-manager's `Issuer` resource
  - Also need multi-namespace mode to sync the namespace scoped `Secret` (created by cert-manager) back to the virtual cluster's namespace so that it can be used by the ingress
- Usage steps:
  - create an Issuer in the virtual cluster
  - create an Ingress in the virtual cluster that uses the Issuer through annotation: `cert-manager.io/issuer: ${ISSUER_NAME}`
  - Check that a `Certificate` resource gets created for the ingress
  - Check that a `Secret` with the name from `spec.tls[0].secretName` gets created and synced back to the vCluster with the generated certificate

### Istio export

Use Istio VirtualService and Gateway resources to expose vCluster services.

{/*
- Use case: Allow users to use `VirtualService` and `Gateway` resources to expose vCluster services
- Configuring generic sync:
  - use example [here](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/tree/main/generic-sync-examples/istio)
  - This example is more advanced, since it shows using `patches` to rewrite parts of the `VirtualService` and `DestinationRule`
- Usage steps:
  - Deploy a sample application, perhaps the one from [istio getting started](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#bookinfo)
  - create the Gateway & VirtualService in the vCluster
  - see that browsing the website works using the host installed Istio
*/}

Follow these steps to use Istio:

1. Install Istio on your host cluster.
1. Deploy an Istio app in the virtual cluster. You can use Istio's BookInfo [app](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/#bookinfo) if you don't have one.
1. Create the VirtualService and Gateway in the virtual cluster by applying the `genericSync` Istio configuration. 
1. Verify that you can browse to the app's website using the host-installed Istio.

### Node info remover hooks (Pro)

<ProAdmonition/>

Configure `hooks` to hide Node images from virtual cluster users. After applying the configuration, you can test by running `kubectl get nodes` in the virtual cluster.

{/*
- Use case: Hide node images from virtual cluster users
- Configuring Hooks:
  - use the [example](https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/generic_resource_patches#example---node-info-remover) from the existing docs
- Usage:
  - `kubectl get nodes` from the vCluster and see that the information is hidden
