{/* 
- Original docs: https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/isolated_control_planes
- Not super clear from the original docs, but this involves deploying two `VirtualClusterInstance` when used with the platform:
  - One that hosts the control plane, where `kubectl` connects and is used to manage workloads
  - One where the workloads are scheduled (headless)
    - when headless, no control plane is deployed
- Previously a platform only feature, where the platform handles
  - creating the kube config
  - passing the required `--remote-kube-config`, `--remote-namespace`, and `--remote-service-name` options
  - adding the `volume` / `volumeMount` to make the kube config available to the syncer
- Possible to use this as a Pro feature, but the user would be responsible for providing:
  - `kubeConfig` is the path to the kubeconfig used to connect to the connected cluster
    - previously `--remote-kube-config`
    - storing the config in a secret or config map
    - mounting this secret or config map as a `volume`
    - giving a `volumeMount` to the syncer container
  - `namespace` of the remote control plane service
    - previously `--remote-namespace`
  - `service` is the name of the remote control plane service
    - previously `--remote-service-name`
  - If one were inclined, you could use a physical cluster as a workload cluster, passing `default` for `namespace` and `kubernetes` for `service`
  - may discourage non-platform users from using this?

The vCluster control plane runs in one cluster, while a second, headless vCluster instance runs workloads in a separate cluster. 

## Key benefits

- **Optimize resource allocation**. Deploy control planes on cost-effective clusters and direct heavy-duty tasks, such as GPU-intensive workloads, to higher-performance clusters.

- **Simplify management**. Offer a straightforward, enforceable, alternative
to each developer managing increasingly complex amounts of taints, tolerations, or node affinities to schedule workloads to the appropriate clusters.

- **Enhance security with control**. Developers can manage workloads via the control plane, even if the workloads reside in a secure zone. This eliminates the need to provide developers with direct cluster access, firewall configurations, and permissions management.

- **Divide responsibilities**. Allow for a clear separation of duties, where one
team oversees the control plane cluster and other teams handle the workload clusters.

| Deprecated Parameter             | Config Field       | 
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ | 
| `--remote-kube-config`  | `kubeConfig` |
| `--remote-namespace`         |  `namespace`        | 
| `--remote-service-name` | `service` |

## Configure remote virtual cluster as workload cluster

```yaml
isolatedControlPlane:
  enabled: true
  headless: true
  kubeConfig: VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
  namespace: VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE
  service: VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_SERVICE
```

Replace the following:

- _`VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG`_: the location of the remote virtual cluster's kubeconfig file
  - Store the kubeconfig in a Secret or ConfigMap.
  - Mount the Secret or ConfigMap as a Volume available to the virtual cluster.
  - Configure the Volume as a VolumeMount in the Syncer.     
- _`VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE`_: the remote virtual cluster's namespace
- _`VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_SERVICE`_: the remote vCluster Service name

## Configure physical cluster as workload cluster

```yaml
isolatedControlPlane:
  enabled: true
  headless: true
  kubeConfig: PHYSICAL_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
  namespace: default
  service: kubernetes
```

Replace _`PHYSICAL_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG`_ with your physical cluster's kubeconfig file.
