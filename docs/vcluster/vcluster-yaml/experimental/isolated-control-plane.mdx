- Original docs: https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/isolated_control_planes
- Not super clear from the original docs, but this involves deploying two `VirtualClusterInstance` when used with the platform:
  - One that hosts the control plane, where `kubectl` connects and is used to manage workloads
  - One where the workloads are scheduled (headless)
    - when headless, no control plane is deployed
- Previously a platform only feature, where the platform handles
  - creating the kube config
  - passing the required `--remote-kube-config`, `--remote-namespace`, and `--remote-service-name` options
  - adding the `volume` / `volumeMount` to make the kube config available to the syncer
- Possible to use this as a Pro feature, but the user would be responsible for providing:
  - `kubeConfig` is the path to the kubeconfig used to connect to the connected cluster
    - previously `--remote-kube-config`
    - storing the config in a secret or config map
    - mounting this secret or config map as a `volume`
    - giving a `volumeMount` to the syncer container
  - `namespace` of the remote control plane service
    - previously `--remote-namespace`
  - `service` is the name of the remote control plane service
    - previously `--remote-service-name`
  - If one were inclined, you could use a physical cluster as a workload cluster, passing `default` for `namespace` and `kubernetes` for `service`
  - may discourage non-platform users from using this?
