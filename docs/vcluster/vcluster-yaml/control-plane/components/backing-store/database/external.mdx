<ProAdmonition/>

Configure this feature if you want to use an external database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL when you are using vanilla Kubernetes, EKS, or k0s. vCluster uses [Kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine) to connect your external database to your Kubernetes distro.

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    database:
      external:
        enabled: true
        dataSource: CONNECTION_STRING
```

Replace _`CONNECTION_STRING`_ with the connection string for your database, such as `postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/vcluster-db`.

:::info K3s Open source feature
Because K3s includes Kine, you can use this feature in the open source tier when you use K3s as your distro.
