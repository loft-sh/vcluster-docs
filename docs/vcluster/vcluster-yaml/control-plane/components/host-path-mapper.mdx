import HostPathMapper from '@site/docs/_partials/config/controlPlane/hostPathMapper.mdx'

- Original Host Path Mapper docs: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/o11y/logging/hpm
- tl;dr: Without re-mapping the paths of the host, logs for vCluster pods will not be resolved correctly by log collectors such as Loki, ELK, or fluentd
- `enabled` will configure the open source host path mapper
  - results in a host path mapper daemonset per node per vCluster
- `central` will configure the pro version of the host path mapper
  - see original docs for reasons to use it: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/o11y/logging/central_hpm
  - improves resource utilization of the host path by only requiring one daemonset for multiple vCluster
  - Loft / VCluster.Pro documentation: https://loft.sh/docs/virtual-clusters/central-hostpath-mapper
