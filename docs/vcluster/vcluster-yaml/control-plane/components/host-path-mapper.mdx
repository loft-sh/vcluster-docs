Virtual cluster internal logging relies on a separate component called the [HostPath Mapper](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster-hostpath-mapper). This component resolves the virtual pod and container names to their physical counterparts. 

If you don't map host paths, logs for vCluster pods are resolved correctly by log collectors such as Loki, ELK, and fluentd.

## vCluster open source

Set `enabled: true` to configure vCluster to deploy a HostPath Mapper DaemonSet per Node per vCluster instance.  

## vCluster pro

The Centralized HostPath Mapper feature supports the following use cases in the virtual cluster:

- Container-based logging used by tools such as fluentd and Logstash.
- Pod-based logging used by Grafana Loki.
- Velero restic backups.
- KubeVirt workloads.

Set `central: true` to configure vCluster to deploy one HostPath Mapper DaemonSet that is used by multiple virtual clusters.
