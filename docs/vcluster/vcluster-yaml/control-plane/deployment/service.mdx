import ControlPlaneService from '@site/docs/_partials/config/controlPlane/service.mdx'

- Defines the service that backs the control plane's ingress, see [Kubernetes Ingress Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) for more detail
- most configuration here is documented already, but it should be noted that if `service.spec` is not given, a default spec will be used. This default spec uses the `service.httpsNodePort` and `service.kubeletNodePort` , but if `service.spec` is provided they are ignored, and it is up to the user to configure the ports properly.
- using `.experimental.isolatedControlPlane.headless` will also change the default spec to expose the required 8443 targetPort for both `https` and `kubelet`
- using `networking.advanced.proxyKubelets.byHostname` or `networking.advanced.proxyKubelets.byIP` will change the default spec to expose the `kubelet` port at 10250
