import ControlPlaneIngress from '@site/docs/_partials/config/controlPlane/ingress.mdx'

- Settings for the ingress to the vCluster's API server in order to deploy to the vCluster
- This is not to be confused with syncing ingresses from the vCluster to the host
- I could not find much existing documentation, however there's [Kubernetes Ingress Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
- User would use this to expose the vCluster's API server at a hostname, and would need to have an ingress controller installed, along with a LoadBalancer service
- most configuration here is documented already, but it should be noted that if `ingress.spec.rules` are not given, a default set of rules will be used. This default rule uses the `ingress.host` and `ingress.pathType` configuration, but if `ingress.spec.rules` is provided they are ignored.
