{/*
`csiDrivers.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- Added as part of this issue: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/773
- tl;dr: syncing these from the host helps the virtual cluster scheduler make decisions about which node to schedule pods to.
*/}

By default, this is disabled. 

Sync [CSIDriver](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/01/15/container-storage-interface-ga/) resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. Use this in conjunction with the virtual scheduler inside of vCluster for more advanced scheduling needs. Syncing the CSIDriver resources from the host helps the virtual scheduler make decisions about which node to schedule pods to.

This is automatically enabled when you enable the [virtual scheduler](/vcluster/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/deployment/advanced/virtual-scheduler). Disabling this option while using the virtual scheduler may result in incorrect pod scheduling.

### Sync CSIDrivers from the host to virtual cluster

```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    csiDrivers:
      enabled: true
```
