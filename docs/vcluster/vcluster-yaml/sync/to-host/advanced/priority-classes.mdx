description: Configure the host scheduler to use a PriorityClass when scheduling your virtual cluster workloads.

import PriorityClasses from '@site/docs/_partials/config/sync/toHost/priorityClasses.mdx'

{/*
`priorityClasses.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
*/}

By default, this is disabled. Sync [PriorityClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/#priorityclass) resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster.

Enable this feature if you need to configure the host scheduler to use a certain PriorityClass that is created within the virtual cluster when scheduling the virtual cluster workloads.

When enabled, vCluster creates or updates the syncer's ClusterRole to include the necessary permissions. 

### Sync PriorityClasses from the virtual to host cluster

```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    priorityClasses:
      enabled: true
```
