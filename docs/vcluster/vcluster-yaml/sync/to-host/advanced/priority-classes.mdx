{/*
`priorityClasses.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
*/}

Sync [PriorityClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/#priorityclass) objects from the virtual cluster to the host cluster.

Enable this feature if you need to configure the host scheduler to use a certain PriorityClass that is created within the virtual cluster when scheduling the virtual cluster workloads.

When enabled, vCluster creates or updates the Syncer's ClusterRole to include the necessary permissions.
