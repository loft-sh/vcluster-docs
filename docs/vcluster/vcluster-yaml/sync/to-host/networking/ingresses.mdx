{/*
`ingresses.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- new ingress version support added with https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/pull/104, but not really worth mentioning in documentation
*/}

Sync all [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. Use this option to make a virtual cluster service available via a hostname/domain without having to install a separate Ingress controller and configure DNS for each virtual cluster. This helps by sharing resources across different vCluster instances.

When `Ingress` syncing is enabled, vCluster automatically tries to detect the supported ingress version (`networking.k8s.io/v1` or `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`). Additionally, [IngressClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class) syncing from the host is enabled automatically to prevent errors resulting from referencing missing ingress classes.
