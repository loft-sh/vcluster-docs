{/*
`ingresses.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- new ingress version support added with https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/pull/104, but not really worth mentioning in documentation
*/}

By default, this is disabled. 

When enabled, sync all [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. Use this option to make a virtual cluster service available via a hostname/domain without having to configure DNS for each virtual cluster. You do, however, need to install a separate Ingress controller for each vCluster instance.

When enabled, vCluster automatically tries to detect the supported ingress version (`networking.k8s.io/v1` or `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`). 

### Sync Ingresses from the virtual to host cluster

```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```
