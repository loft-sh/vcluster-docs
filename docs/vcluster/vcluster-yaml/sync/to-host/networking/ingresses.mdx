`ingresses.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- new ingress version support added with https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/pull/104, but not really worth mentioning in documentation

Sync all [Ingresses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. Use this option to make a virtual cluster service available via a hostname/domain without having to install a separate Ingress controller and configure DNS for each virtual cluster. This helps by sharing resources across different vCluster instances.

When syncing is enabled, vCluster automatically tries to detect the supported ingress version (`networking.k8s.io/v1` or `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`).

:::info
With Ingress syncing enabled, you manage SSL certificates as you normally would. Since the Syncer keeps typical SSL provisioning-related annotations for Ingress resources, you may also set the cert-manager Ingress annotations on an Ingress resource in your virtual clusters in order to use the cert-manager of the underlying host cluster to automatically provision SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt.

### Sync all ingresses from virtual to host cluster
```YAML
sync:
 toHost:
   ingresses:
     enabled: true
```
