Sync [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) resources that are used by pods. Apps frequently need configuration data to function, so ConfigMap syncing is enabled by default.


### Sync used ConfigMaps from the virtual to host cluster

Sync any ConfigMap that is used by a Pod synced from the virtual to host cluster. 

```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
```

### Sync all ConfigMaps from the virtual to host cluster

If you have a resource in the host cluster monitoring ConfigMap objects that aren't required by a Pod to run, then you can enable the `all` option.

```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      all: true
```
