A virtual cluster does not have actual worker nodes or a network. Instead, the vCluster Syncer component replicates the pods that are created within the virtual cluster to the host cluster. Subsequently, the host cluster schedules the pods, and the Syncer keeps the virtual cluster pods and host cluster pods in sync.

By default, vCluster runs with a minimal set of RBAC permissions to allow execution in restricted environments. Certain resources require extra permissions to sync, which will automatically be given to the vCluster ServiceAccount if you enable the resource sync with the associated config value.

This table lists all supported resources that can be synced by vCluster. You can activate or deactivate via the `vcluster.yaml`. By default, certain resources are already synced and you can either disable the default resource syncing or tell vCluster to sync other supported resources as well.
