This table lists all resources that can be synced or mirrored by vCluster. You can activate or deactivate via the `vcluster.yaml`. By default, certain resources are already activated and you can either disable the default resources or tell vCluster to sync other supported resources as well.

_\* refer to the description column for clarifying information about default behavior._

By default, vCluster runs with a minimal set of RBAC permissions to allow execution in restricted environments. Certain resources require extra permissions, which will be automatically given to the vCluster ServiceAccount if you enable the resource sync with the associated config value.
