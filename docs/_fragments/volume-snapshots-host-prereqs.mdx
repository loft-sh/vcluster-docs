- You should install [the volume snapshots validating webhook](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter#validating-webhook) in your vCluster instance.
- Your host cluster must have all relevant [snapshot CRDs](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter/tree/master/client/config/crd) installed, without which the vCluster instance fails to start when volume snapshots sync is enabled.
- You should install a common snapshot controller on your host cluster, as well as a compatible CSI driver. Without these, vCluster cannot create the volume snapshots in the storage backend.
