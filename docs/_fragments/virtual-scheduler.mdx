By default, vCluster reuses the host cluster scheduler to schedule workloads. This saves computing resources, but also has some limitations:

1. Labeling nodes inside the virtual cluster has no effect on scheduling, unless [enabling real node syncing](/vcluster/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes) with `syncBackChanges` enabled.
2. Draining or tainting nodes inside the virtual cluster has no effect on scheduling.
3. You cannot use custom schedulers inside the virtual cluster.

Sometimes you want to label a node inside the virtual cluster to modify workload scheduling through features such as [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) or [topology spreading](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/). vCluster supports running a scheduler inside the virtual cluster instead of reusing the host cluster's scheduler. vCluster then only syncs pods that already have a node assigned to the host cluster. When you enable this feature, you can taint and label nodes inside the virtual cluster without actually modifying the host cluster nodes.

:::info
If the `persistentvolumeclaims` syncer is also enabled, relevant `csistoragecapacity`,`csinode`, and `csidriver` objects will be mirrored to the virtual cluster so the scheduler can make storage-aware scheduling decisions.
