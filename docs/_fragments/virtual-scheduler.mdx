By default, vCluster reuses the host cluster scheduler to schedule workloads. This saves computing resources, but also has some limitations:

1. Labeling nodes inside the virtual cluster has no effect on scheduling.
2. Draining or tainting nodes inside the virtual cluster has no effect on scheduling.
3. You cannot use custom schedulers inside the virtual cluster.

Sometimes you want to label a node inside the virtual cluster to modify workload scheduling through features such as [affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) or [topology spreading](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/). vCluster supports running a scheduler inside the virtual cluster instead of reusing the host cluster's scheduler. vCluster then only syncs pods that already have a node assigned to the host cluster. When you enable this feature, you can taint and label nodes inside the virtual cluster without actually modifying the host cluster nodes.

:::info
If the `persistentvolumeclaims` syncer is also enabled, relevant `csistoragecapacity`,`csinode`, and `csidriver` objects will be mirrored to the virtual cluster so the scheduler can make storage-aware scheduling decisions.
