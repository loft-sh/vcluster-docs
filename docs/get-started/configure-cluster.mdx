You configure your virtual clusters using the vCluster configuration file called `vcluster.yaml`. This guide includes some examples to illustrate what you can do. See the `vcluster.yaml` [config section](/vcluster-yaml/README.mdx) for detailed configuration options.

## Sync ingress resources

### From host to virtual

If you want to use an ingress controller from the host cluster in your virtual cluster, enable syncing from host to virtual:


```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    ingressClasses:
      enabled: true
```

### From virtual to host

## Choose a Kubernetes distribution

:::warning
You cannot change the Kubernetes distro of a deployed virtual cluster.
:::

vCluster uses [Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s)](https://k3s.io/) by default but supports most Kubernetes distributions. In this example, you enable the vanilla Kubernetes distro. When choosing this option, vCluster deploys a separate etcd cluster, Kubernetes controller manager, and Kubernetes API server alongside the vCluster hypervisor.

```yaml
controlPlane:
  distro:
    k8s:
      enabled: true
```

## Change Node behavior

By default, vCluster creates a [pseudo node](/architecture/nodes.mdx) for every pod `spec.nodeName` that it encounters within the virtual cluster. The fake node has a different name and made-up spec.

If you need to access specific nodes for scheduling, 

In this example, you change the behavior of how vCluster shows nodes inside the virtual cluster.



To see real nodes, create a `vcluster.yaml` file with this content:

```yaml
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
```

This enables you to see the real node names and the real spec of the nodes as they are in the underlying host cluster.

After updating the virtual cluster, view the nodes again:

`kubectl get nodes`

See the [vcluster.yaml node section](/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes.mdx) for a detailed config reference.


## Replicate a host service

In this example, you map a service `my-host-service` in the namespace `my-host-namespace` to the virtual cluster service `my-virtual-service` in the virtual cluster namespace `vcluster-my-vcluster`.

```yaml
replicateServices:
  fromHost:
    - from: my-host-namespace/my-host-service
      to: vcluster-my-vcluster/my-virtual-service
```

<DeployChangesFrag/>

vCluster replicates the service in the virtual cluster and points the virtual cluster service to the host cluster service. Pods inside the virtual cluster can access the host service using `my-virtual-service.my-virtual-namespace` syntax. For example, if you use cURL, the command is `curl http://my-virtual-service.my-virtual-namespace`.

See the `vcluster.yaml` [config section](/vcluster-yaml/networking/replicate-services.mdx) for a detailed config reference.
