# Glossary Demo

This page demonstrates the GlossaryTerm component.

## Example Usage

<GlossaryTerm term="vcluster">vCluster</GlossaryTerm> is a powerful tool for creating isolated environments. It runs inside a <GlossaryTerm term="host-cluster">host cluster</GlossaryTerm> and creates a <GlossaryTerm term="virtual-cluster">virtual cluster</GlossaryTerm>.

When using <GlossaryTerm term="platform">the platform</GlossaryTerm>, you can organize your resources in a <GlossaryTerm term="project">project</GlossaryTerm>.

## Missing Term Example

Here's an example of a term that's not in the glossary: <GlossaryTerm term="non-existent-term">This is a non-existent term</GlossaryTerm>.

This error only shows up with a red dotted underline in development mode. In production, it just displays normally without the underline.
