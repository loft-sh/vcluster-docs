import NetworkPolicy from '@site/docs/_partials/config/policies/networkPolicy.mdx'

`networkPolicy`:
- Also part of [Isolated Mode](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/isolated-mode)

`networkPolicy.fallbackDns`:
- The IP address of a DNS server to fall back to if the vcluster's DNS server is not able to resolve the hostname
- This isn't related to the kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resource. IMO this is coredns configuration, and not related to network policies
- previously this was `coredns.fallback`. unsure of why it was moved to `networkPolicy`.

`networkingPolicy.outgoingConnections`:
  - `ipBlock` has the same semantics as documented in the [Kubernetes Network Policy documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
    - `cidr` is a list of IP address ranges that are allowed.
    - `except` is a list of IP address ranges that are NOT allowed.

`networkingPolicy.annotations`:
- annotations to add to the NetworkPolicy resource

`networkingPolicy.labels`:
- labels to add to the NetworkPolicy resource
