import ResourceQuota from '@site/docs/_partials/config/policies/resourceQuota.mdx'

`resourceQuota`:
- original docs page: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/quotas-limits
- Also part of [Isolated Mode](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/security/isolated-mode)

`resourceQuota.quota`:
- These are the quota limit definitions, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/#viewing-and-setting-quotas
- An example is setting a CPU request limit:
    ```
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ResourceQuota
      metadata:
        name: compute-resources
      spec:
        hard:
          limits.cpu: "2"
    ```
- Because vCluster usage is typically scoped to a single namespace is the host cluster, these resource quotas would apply to all resources synced to the host cluster.
- It's important to note that the quotas are enforced by the host cluster, and therefore would only apply to resources that are synced to the host cluster.

`resourceQuota.scopeSelector`:
- See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/#quota-scopes

`resourceQuota.scopes`:
- See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/#quota-scopes

`resourceQuota.annotations`:
- annotations to add to the ResourceQuota resource

`resourceQuota.labels`:
- labels to add to the ResourceQuota resource
