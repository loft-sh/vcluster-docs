With open source vCluster, you need to replicate services between the host cluster and virtual cluster.

## Host cluster to virtual cluster

In this example, you map a service `my-host-service` in the namespace `my-host-namespace` to the virtual cluster service `my-virtual-service` in the virtual cluster namespace `my-virtual-namespace`.

```yaml
replicateServices:
  fromHost:
  - from: my-host-namespace/my-host-service
    to: my-virtual-namespace/my-virtual-service
```

vCluster replicates the service in the virtual cluster, with the virtual cluster service pointing to the service running in the host cluster. Pods inside the virtual cluster can access the host service using `my-virtual-service.my-virtual-namespace` syntax. For example, if you use cURL, the command is `curl http://my-virtual-service.my-virtual-namespace`.

## Virtual cluster to host cluster

You can also map a virtual cluster service to a host cluster service. This is especially useful if you want to expose an application that runs inside the virtual cluster to other workloads running in the host cluster, which makes it easier to share services across vCluster instances.

In this example, you map the virtual service `my-virtual-service` in the namespace `my-virtual-namespace` to the host namespace service `my-host-service`

```yaml
replicateServices:
  toHost:
  - from: my-virtual-namespace/my-virtual-service
    to: my-host-service
```

With this configuration, vCluster manages a service called `my-host-service` inside the namespace where the vCluster workloads are synced, which points to the virtual service `my-virtual-service` in namespace `my-virtual-namespace` inside the virtual cluster. Pods in the host cluster are able to access the virtual service by calling the host service. If you use cURL, the command based on the preceding example is `curl http://my-host-service`.
