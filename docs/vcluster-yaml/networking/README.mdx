## Ingress traffic

### Ingress --> Service

The vCluster has the option to enable Ingress resources synchronization. That means that you can create an ingress in a vCluster to make a service in this vCluster available via a hostname/domain. However, instead of having to run a separate ingress controller in each vCluster, the ingress resource will be synchronized to the underlying cluster (when enabled) which means that the vCluster can use a shared ingress controller that is running in the host cluster. This helps to share resources across different vClusters and is easier for users of vClusters because otherwise, they would need to install an ingress controller and manually configure DNS for each vCluster.

## From inside a virtual cluster

### Pod (vCluster) --> Pod (same vCluster)

Pods run inside the underlying host cluster. vCluster's [syncer component](/architecture/syncer.mdx) syncs Pods between host and virtual cluster.
These synced Pods have cluster-internal IP addresses and can communicate with each other via IP-based networking.

No additional configuration is required for Pod --> Pod networking in the same vCluster to work.

### Pod (vCluster) --> Service (same vCluster)

vCluster also synchronizes Services (while stripping away unnecessary information from the resource) to allow Pods to communicate with services.
However, instead of using the DNS names of the Services inside the host cluster, vCluster has its own DNS service which allows the virtual cluster Pods to use much more intuitive DNS mappings, just as in a regular cluster.

No additional configuration is required for Pod --> Service networking in the same vCluster to work.

### Pod (vCluster) --> Service (host cluster)
See [Host cluster to virtual cluster](/vcluster-yaml/networking/replicate-services#host-cluster-to-virtual-cluster)

### Pod (vCluster) --> Service (different vCluster instances)
See [Mapping services across vCluster instances](/vcluster-yaml/networking/resolve-dns#mapping-services-across-vcluster-instances)

## From The Host Cluster

### Pod (Host) --> Service (Inside vCluster)
