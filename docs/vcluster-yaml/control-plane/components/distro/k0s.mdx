[Zero Friction Kuberntes (k0s)](https://k0sproject.io/) is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. See the [k0s docs](https://docs.k0sproject.io/) for k0s' features.

:::warning
vCluster does not support dual stack networking when you use k0s. You can to deploy k0s on a dual stack host cluster, but it does not have all the dual stack features.
