import ControlPlaneObservability from '@site/docs/_partials/config/controlPlane/serviceMonitor.mdx'

- Used when using [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/prologue/introduction/) to monitor the vCluster control plane.
- The ServiceMonitor is used to configure Prometheus to scrap metrics from a service
- vCluster exposes metrics over https at a `/metrics` endpoint
- Prometheus handles scraping & aggregating metrics (in the case of high availability), and provides a query engine.
- Visualization tools such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) can then use Prometheus as a data source to graph / monitor / alert the vCluster control plane
