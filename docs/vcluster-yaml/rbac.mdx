import RBAC from '@site/docs/_partials/config/rbac.mdx'

- In general, adjusting RBAC rules is not needed. Most are automatically generated by enabling resource syncing via `sync.toHost` & `sync.fromHost`.
- This looks to have been deprecated up to version 0.19, where it was refactored to be similar to this format.
- `overwriteRules` will prevent the default syncer based RBAC rules from being generated, allowing for complete control over the vCluster's permissions
- `extraRules` would be appended to the default syncer based RBAC rules, allowing for additional permissions
- FWIW, both the `plugins` configuration & `genericSync` configuration have the ability to add their required rules for syncing non-native resources
- The default rules will also adjust when `experimental.multiNamespaceMode` mode is enabled, adding permissions to manage `namespaces` and `serviceaccounts`.
- One reason to use these might be grant access to existing resources for the vCluster to use. For example, there might be an existing service account that the vCluster should use instead of the one created by the Helm chart.
