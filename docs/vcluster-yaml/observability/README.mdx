You can monitor your virtual cluster either from the host cluster or directly from within the virtual cluster.

vCluster is able to rewrite node stats and metrics. This means monitoring a virtual cluster works similar to [monitoring a regular Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-usage-monitoring/).

By default, vCluster creates a service for each node that redirects incoming traffic from within the virtual cluster to the node kubelet to vCluster itself. This means that traffic reaches vCluster first if workloads within the virtual cluster try to scrape node metrics. vCluster redirects the incoming request to the host cluster and rewrites the response (pod names, pod namespaces etc) and returns it to the requester.

:::info
vCluster needs RBAC permissions to access host Node metrics from within the virtual cluster. You enable these permissions when you [enable real nodes synchronization](/architecture/nodes.mdx).

## Monitoring

By default, vCluster creates a service for each node which redirects incoming traffic from within the vCluster to the node kubelet to vCluster itself. This means that if workloads within the vCluster try to scrape node metrics the traffic reaches vCluster first. Vcluster will redirect the incoming request to the host cluster and rewrite the response (pod names, pod namespaces etc) and return it to the requester.

vCluster exposes metrics endpoints on `https://0.0.0.0:8443/metrics` (syncer metrics) and `https://0.0.0.0:6444/metrics` (K3s metrics). In order to scrape those metrics, you need to send an `Authorization` header with a valid virtual cluster service account token that has permissions to access the `/metrics` endpoint within the vcluster.

- The needed role to scrape metrics are added automatically by the Helm chart.
  - node metrics permissions are added [here](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/blob/main/chart/templates/clusterrole.yaml#L83-L85)
  - pod metrics permissions are added [here](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/blob/main/chart/templates/role.yaml#L51-L53)
- The note about service account & `Authorization` header here is if a user wants to scrape metrics using their own client or a different deployment
  - very general steps are (if needed):
    - create a role with the permissions above
    - crete a service account
    - bind the service account to the role with a role binding
    - create a pod that uses the service account by setting `spec.serviceAccount`
    - read the token from `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`
    - finally add the `Authorization` header with the token value

### For workloads inside the virtual cluster

- See original docs here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/o11y/metrics/metrics_server
- Also see this page: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/o11y/metrics/metrics_server_proxy
- As mentioned, you can get metrics either from the vcluster or the host
  - These proxied metrics endpoints give a vCluster scoped view of the metrics (pods metrics will have the vCluster's pod name, etc)
  - This information is available from the host as well, but will have the synced name of the pods as when viewed from the host

### For Each vCluster Control Plane

- See original docs here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/o11y/metrics/monitoring_vcluster#monitoring-the-vcluster-statefulset
- These are metrics exposed by the control plane distribution (k3s, k8s, k0s), but should be standardized as described in [Metrics for Kubernetes System Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics/)
  - These metrics are likely enabled by default, but it will depend on the distribution
- This is not related to the `observability.metrics` settings described below, so I'm not sure if these details belong here.


### For The vCluster Platform
- I believe this is covered by the existing docs here: https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/guides/aggregating-metrics
- This is not related to the `observability.metrics` settings described below.
- [Metrics Guide](/docs/platform/admin/guides/metrics#metrics)


`observability.metrics.proxy.nodes`:
- grants the needed role to access host node metrics
- creates a proxy service that translates metrics responses from the host's metric-server installation

`observability.metrics.proxy.pods`:
- grants the needed role to access host pods metrics
- creates a proxy service that translates metrics responses from the host's metric-server installation
