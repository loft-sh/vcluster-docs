Sync [ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts/) objects from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. 

This is useful for using [AWS IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) with the virtual cluster. In this scenario, the host cluster is defined as the identity provider to access your OIDC compatible system rather than configuring each virtual cluster as a provider. A host cluster service account token is created for your syncronized service account from the virtual cluster. 

### Sync ServiceAccounts from virtual to host cluster
```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    serviceAccounts:
      enabled: true
```
