{/*
`persistentVolumes.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
*/}

Sync [PersistentVolume resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. By default, this is disabled, which means that vCluster creates pseudo PersistentVolume resources instead. Enabling PersistentVolume syncing is not necessary in order to use PersistentVolumeClaim syncing.

Enable this feature if you have a scenario that require details about the PersistentVolume and its IDs, such as when you use Valero or specific CSI drivers.

See [Storage](/architecture/storage.mdx) for details on how this feature works.
