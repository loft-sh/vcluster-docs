Sync [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. This is enabled by default. 

### Sync only utilized secrets from virtual to host cluster
```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    secrets:
      enabled: true
```

### Sync all secrets from virtual to host cluster
vCluster only knows about a couple of virtual cluster resources that actually use secrets and tries to sync only those into the host cluster. You can enable syncing all virtual cluster secrets to avoid the problem that needed secrets are not synced to the host cluster.
```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    secrets:
      enabled: true
      all: true
```
