Sync ConfigMap resources that are used by pods from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. This is enabled by default. 


### Sync used ConfigMaps from the virtual to host cluster
Sync any ConfigMap that is used by a Pod that gets synced from the virtual to host cluster. 
```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
```

### Sync all ConfigMaps from the virtual to host cluster
If you have a resource in the host cluster monitoring ConfigMap objects that aren't required by a Pod to run, then you can enable the `all` option.
```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      all: true
```
