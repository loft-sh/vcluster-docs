import EnableSwitch from '@site/docs/_partials/config/sync/fromHost/storageClasses/enabled.mdx'

Sync created storage classes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. See [Storage](/architecture/storage.mdx) for more information.

{/*
`storageClasses.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- more context behind this config: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/pull/378
- looks like this is a rare resource that is scheduled both from and to the host cluster
  - my understanding is that you can simply use the host cluster's storage classes by default, and the from host syncing is for referenctial integrity
  - if one needs to customize the storage used by vCluster persistent volumes, this would be a reason to define a storage class in the vCluster that then gets synced to the host
  - may want to verify this assessment with Rohan / Fabian
