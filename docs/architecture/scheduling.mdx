vCluster runs your workloads by replicating pods from the virtual cluster to the host cluster and uses the [Syncer](/architecture/syncer.mdx) component to sychrone those pods. 
To control how vCluster pods are scheduled on the host cluster, you may need to pass additional arguments to the Syncer, or configure certain `vcluster.yaml` values during vCluster installation and upgrade.

## Separate virtual cluster scheduler

<VirtualScheduler/>

See the [Virtual scheduler section][virtualScheduler] for how to configure this feature.

## Reuse host scheduler

You can customize to a certain degree how the host scheduler schedules your virtual cluster workloads:

1. [Configure](/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/advanced/priority-classes.mdx) the host scheduler to use priority classes when scheduling virtual cluster workloads.
1. [Configure](/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes.mdx) Node sync to limit pod scheduling to selected nodes.
1. [Configure](/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/core/pods.mdx) vCluster to automatically apply tolerations to all synchronized pods.
