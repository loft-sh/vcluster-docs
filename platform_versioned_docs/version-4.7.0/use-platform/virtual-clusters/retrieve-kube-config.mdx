To connect to a virtual cluster's Kubernetes API server, you can either manually create a kubeconfig file or use the vCluster CLI to generate and update it automatically.

## Retrieve using the vCluster CLI

The easiest way to retrieve a kubeconfig for your virtual cluster is by using the vCluster CLI.

You can update your current kubeconfig on your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
vcluster platform connect my-vcluster
```

If you want to print the kubeconfig file, you can append `--print` to the command:

```bash
vcluster platform connect my-vcluster --print
```

:::info
If you have multiple virtual clusters with the same name, a sub-menu will be presented that allows you to specify the vCluster by project.

:::info
If you have direct [cluster endpoints](../../administer/clusters/advanced/multi-region-mode.mdx) or
[ingress endpoints for virtual clusters](/docs/vcluster/next/key-features/ingress-access)
enabled, the resulting kubeconfig will look different.

## Create kubeconfig without the CLI

You can also create a kubeconfig manually by creating an [access key](../../administer/authentication/access-keys) for
your user first and then using the following template, with the following placeholders:

- **$PROJECT**: the project the virtual cluster is in
- **$VIRTUAL_CLUSTER**: the virtual cluster name to connect to
- **$PLATFORM_URL**: the platform host you connect to
- **$ACCESS_KEY**: the access key to use

Then replace the placeholders in the following template and save the configuration as `my-kubeconfig.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
  - cluster:
      server: https://$PLATFORM_URL/kubernetes/project/$PROJECT/virtualcluster/$VIRTUAL_CLUSTER
      # Optional: if the server uses an insecure certificate
      # insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    name: loft
contexts:
  - context:
      cluster: loft
      user: loft
    name: loft
current-context: loft
users:
  - name: loft
    user:
      token: $ACCESS_KEY
```

You can access your virtual cluster by using the freshly created kubeconfig file:

```bash
KUBECONFIG=my-kubeconfig.yaml kubectl get namespaces
```
