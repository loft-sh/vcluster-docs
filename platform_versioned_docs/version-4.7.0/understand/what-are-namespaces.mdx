Namespaces are regular Kubernetes namespaces managed by vCluster Platform that are owned by a user or team.
In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.

In vCluster Platform, each namespace belongs to a host cluster and project. A Namespace can be [created from a template](../../next/use-platform/namespaces/create/create-with-template) to ensure the Kubernetes namespace and objects within it conform to isolation best practices
or [created manually in vCluster Platform UI](../../next/use-platform/namespaces/create/create-no-template) for project admins.
Admins can also easily [manage access to a Namespace](../../next/administer/users-permissions/permissions/namespace) and users can [connect to the Namespace via CLI](../../next/use-platform/namespaces/retrieve-kube-config). 

:::info
For applications that require multiple namespaces or need to create cluster scoped resources, [virtual clusters](what-are-virtual-clusters.mdx) are recommended instead.

There are multiple key features you can use with namespaces:
- [Auto Sleep & Auto Delete](../../use-platform/namespaces/key-features/sleep-mode) that puts namespaces to sleep when nobody is using them or delete namespaces that have been
idle for a while.
- [Isolation](../../use-platform/namespaces/key-features/isolation) that applies ResourceQuotas, LimitRanges, and NetworkPolicies to a Namespace.
- [Prevent Deletion](../../use-platform/namespaces/key-features/prevent-deletion) that prevents a Namespace from deletion.
- [Custom Links](../../use-platform/namespaces/key-features/custom-links) that adds custom links to namespaces that point to external resources such as GitHub pull requests, Jira issues, or documentation.
