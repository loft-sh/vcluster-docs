# Overview
When a **vCluster Platform** is deployed on a host cluster (or, primary host cluster), it can act as a centralized control plane. Other host clusters can connect to the vCluster Platform running on the primary host cluster and be managed by it. In this architecture:
- The primary host cluster runs the vCluster Platform.
- Other host clusters connect to the primary host cluster and run the vCluster Platform Agent.
- The Platform coordinates and manages all connected host clusters through their agents.
- There are both vCluster Platform and vCluster Platform agent running on the primary host cluster. The vCluster Platform manages the primary host cluster through its vCluster Platform Agent as well.

Agent settings are the content in the [`values.yaml`](../introduction.mdx) under the `agentValues`. It controls the behavior of vCluster Platform Agents installed in the host clusters 
that are managed by the vCluster Platform.

The `agentValues` behavior is as follows:
- By default, `agentValues` is an empty object `{}`.
- An empty `agentValues` object means that agents installed on connected host clusters will inherit the same configuration as the platform running on the primary host cluster.
- You can populate `agentValues` to override the default agent configuration globally for all connected host clusters.

## Connect to platform {#connect-to-platform}
A new cluster can be connected to the platform through the UI or CLI:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ui"
  values={[
    {label: 'UI', value: 'ui'},
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'Helm', value: 'helm'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ui">
    <PartialClusterConnectUI />
        :::tip Connect a cluster
UI will generate a CLI command that can be used to connect the cluster. Make
sure to check the `CLI` tab for working with the command.
:::


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">
    <PartialClusterConnectCLI />


  :::info platform login
    <ConnectPlatform />

  If your kubectl context is not set to the cluster with running platform, it's
  possible to login to the platform using the CLI and access key.
  If you haven't already, you need to [create access key](/docs/platform/administer/authentication/access-keys#create-an-access-key) to be able to login to the platform.

  ```bash title="Login to the platform using access key"
  vcluster platform login [platform-url] --access-key [access-key]
  ```

  :::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="helm">
    <PartialClusterConnectHelm />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When connecting a new cluster, the user creates a new cluster resource and obtains
a pre-shared key (PSK) that the user then uses to bootstrap the agent.
The agent then utilizes this key to reach the control plane, authenticate itself,
and establish a secure WireGuard-based, user-space tunnel.

<EnrollmentSvg width="100%"/>

If the agent cannot establish a direct WireGuard-based connection, the agents
falls back to utilising the control plane as a Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets.
The control plane relay is comparable to the same role as TURN servers in the ICE
standard, using HTTPS streams (or WebSockets) and WireGuards keys instead.

If you encounter issues while configuring agent values or deploying it manually, you might want to take a look at the [Cluster troubleshooting](troubleshooting.mdx) guide.

## Find agent pods

The platform agent runs as a pod in each connected cluster. Locate agent pods to verify connectivity and troubleshoot issues:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`kubectl get pods -n [[VAR:MANAGEMENT_NAMESPACE:vcluster-platform]] -l app=loft`}
  language="bash"
  title="List agent pods"
/>

Example output:
```
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
loft-d6c6d5576-7kqwx   1/1     Running   0          9d
```

## Retrieve agent values

For a platform instance on host `nimbus.vcluster.cloud` with a connected cluster named `staging`, the following table shows how to retrieve agent values for each tier. Use these endpoints to determine current agent configuration or to layer values instead of overriding them.

You can specify multiple values files:
```bash
--values=https://<platform-config-endpoint> --values=https://<cluster-annotation-endpoint>
```
An [access key](/docs/platform/administer/authentication/access-keys#how-access-keys-work) is required for authentication.
