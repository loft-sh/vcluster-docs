# Overview
Installation options are the content in the [`values.yaml`](../introduction.mdx) except the content under the `config` section and the `agentValues` section.
It contains fields like `resources`, `replicas`, `ingress` and also custom fields like `admin`, `product`, `agentOnly`.

You set values of installation options to customize the deployment of vCluster Platform. These installation options are not available in the vCluster Platform UI after the vCluster Platform 
is installed in the host cluster but can only be [applied using `helm`](../introduction#applying-configuration) before the deployment.

## Installation modes

Both **vCluster Platform** and **vCluster Platform Agent** are installed using the same Helm chart: `vcluster-platform`. The installation mode is controlled by the `agentOnly` value in the `values.yaml`:
```yaml
agentOnly: false
# Installs the vCluster Platform (control plane).
agentOnly: true
# Installs the vCluster Platform Agent.
```
