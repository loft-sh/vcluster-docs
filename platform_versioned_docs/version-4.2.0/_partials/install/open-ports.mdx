- Ensure that the required network ports are open.

    :::info  
    The platform requires open ports for API extensions, webhooks, and cost monitoring. In private GKE clusters, ensure firewall rules allow traffic from the Kubernetes master to platform components.  
    :::

    - `8443` – API service extension for cluster communication (`v1.cluster.loft.sh`)  
    - `9443` – Webhook validation and enforcement (`loft webhook`)  
    - `9444` – Management API for platform administration (`v1.management.loft.sh`)  
    - `9090` – Prometheus metrics proxy for cost monitoring
