## OIDC authentication

[OpenID Connect Specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, providing secure and standardized user authentication for applications. Implementing OIDC in the platform offers several benefits:

- Enhanced security through token-based authentication
- Simplified user management with centralized identity providers
- Improved user experience with `single sign-on` (SSO) capabilities

<Step>

**Create platform config for OIDC**

To configure OIDC for SSO, follow these steps:

- Navigate to `Admin > Config` in the platform.
- Adjust your configuration as shown in the example below.

```yaml title="Platform OIDC configuration"
auth:
  # Tell vCluster Platform to allow OIDC for authentication
  oidc:
    #
    #
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # IssuerURL is the URL the provider signs ID Tokens as.
    # If using Keycloak provide the realm as well, only providing the base URL will return a 404. Ex. https://your-keycloak/realms/YOUR-REALM
    issuerUrl: https://accounts.google.com
    # ClientID the JWT must be issued for, the "sub" field. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $CLIENTID
    # ClientSecret to issue tokens from the OIDC provider. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $CLIENTSECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/oidc/callback
    redirectURI: https://vcluster-platform.my.domain/auth/oidc/callback
    #
    #
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) Path to a PEM encoded root certificate of the provider.
    caFile: /tmp/ca-file.crt
    # (Optional) Specify whether to communicate without validating SSL certificates
    insecureCa: false
    # (Optional) UsernameClaim is the JWT field to use as the user's username.
    # If not set defaults to email.
    usernameClaim: email
    # (Optional) If specified, causes claims mapping to username to be prefix with
    # the provided value.
    usernamePrefix: my-prefix-
    # (Optional) If specified, causes the OIDCAuthenticator to try to populate the user's
    # groups with an ID Token field.
    groupsClaim: groups
    # (Optional) If specified, causes claims mapping to group names to be prefixed with the
    # value.
    groupsPrefix: group-prefix-
    # (Optional) If groups is non empty, access is denied if the user is not part of at least one
    # of the specified groups. This requires groupsClaim to be set!
    groups: ["my-oidc-group"]
    # (Optional) If specified, tells the OIDCAuthenticator to try to populate the user's
    # information from the UserInfo. This might be necessary for slim tokens such as used
    # by Okta
    getUserInfo: false
    # (Optional) Scopes that should be sent to the server. If empty, defaults to "email" and "profile".
    scopes: ["profile", "email"]
    # (Optional) EmailClaim is the JWT field to use as the user's email.
    emailClaim: "email"
    # (Optional) vCluster PlatformUsernameClaim is the JWT field to use as the user's ID (Kubernetes name) and username
    loftUsernameClaim: "name"
    # (Optional) PreferredUsername is the JWT field to use as the user's display name
    preferredUsername: "preferred_username"
```

:::info Obtaining OIDC credentials
To obtain the required `clientId` and `clientSecret`, refer to your OIDC provider's documentation. Common providers include:
- [Google Identity](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
- [Okta OpenID](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/)
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation)

**Authenticate via OIDC**

After saving the new configuration, the platform should restart. You should then be able to log in via your OIDC provider.
