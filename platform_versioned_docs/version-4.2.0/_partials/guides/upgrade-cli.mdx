To upgrade the platform via vCluster CLI, update `$PLATFORM_VERSION` with a
valid platform version and run:

```bash title="Upgrade the platform"
vcluster platform start --upgrade --version=$PLATFORM_VERSION --values=vcluster-platform.yaml
```

:::info Versions and Values
The `$PLATFORM_VERSION` variable is an environment variable set to your desired
platform version to
deploy. The `vcluster-platform.yaml` file is an optional YAML file that contains Helm values you would like
to use when upgrading your platform deployment.
