  With sleep mode, you can put {props.name}s to sleep which means that
  vCluster Platform will set <code>replicas: 0</code> for all replica-controlled
  resources such as <code>Deployments</code> and <code>StatefulSets</code>{" "}
  inside the {props.name}. This means that Kubernetes will delete all pods but
  the entire configuration of resources within the {props.name} is still there.


Sleep mode can be:
<ul>
  <li>Invoked manually</li>
  <li>
    Triggered by an inactivity timeout (no one has run a <code>kubectl</code>{" "}
    command or accessed an ingress in this {props.name} for X minutes)
  </li>
  <li>Scheduled using a CRON syntax</li>
</ul>
