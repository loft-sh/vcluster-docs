Project secrets allow you to define and share secrets across the allowed clusters 
where namespace and virtual cluster instances of the project are deployed. There are two ways to utilize project secrets:

1. Create project secrets and populate it with its own secret data.
2. Create a project secret that syncs with a shared secret. 

In both cases, to utilize the secret data, you will create a regular Kubernetes secret with labels referring to the project secret. Once created, vCluster Platform 
will handle synchronizing the project secret data to your secret.

:::note Data or Shared Secrets, but not both
It is not possible to define data custom in a project secret and synchronize a shared secret. If you need to define additional secret data that is specific to your project, it is best to create a separate secret, and combine them in your pod specifications.

## Create a Project Secret with Custom Data

To create a project secret with its own data follow these steps:

<Flow id="secret-create-project-secret-data">
  <Step>
    Navigate to the <NavStep>Projects</NavStep> view using the menu on the left
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select the project you'd like to configure using the drop down menu
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on <NavStep>Project Secrets</NavStep>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add a display name, such as "My Secret" and optional description for the
    project secret. The UI will automatically fill in the `.metadata.name` with
    `my-secret`. If you wish to change this name you may edit the YAML directly
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the <Label>Secret Data</Label> input, add your secret key/value pairs
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button to save your changes
  </Step>
</Flow>

Once the project secret has been created, head over to the [Secret Sync](../../../use-platform/secrets/secret-sync) page to learn how to use the project secret data from a Pod.

Global secrets can be used in projects by creating a project secret that is synchronized by a global secret. This provides a way to manage secret data across many projects.

## Creating Project Secrets synced from a Global Secret

When you have a global secret defined in the platform and wish to use it inside your project, you can create a project secret to be synced
from the global secret.

:::note Global Secret Permissions
When creating a project secret that refers to a global secret you must have permissions to read the shared secret or
the request will be denied.
:::

<Flow id="create-project-secret-from-shared-secret">
  <Step>
    Select the project you'd like to configure using the drop down menu. Click on <Label>Secrets</Label>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add a display name, such as "My Secret" and optional description for the
    project secret. The UI will automatically fill in the `.metadata.name` with
    `my-secret`. If you wish to change this name you may edit the YAML directly.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    In the <NavStep>Data</NavStep>, select the
    global secret that you wish to sync to the project secret in the <Label>Optional: Global Secret </Label> section.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on <NavStep>Permissions</NavStep>. Add which users and teams have access and permissions to modify the project secret.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create Secret</Button> button to save your changes.
  </Step>
</Flow>


The global secret's data will be synchronized with the project secret momentarily. Using this configuration, updates to the shared secret will automatically propagate down to the project secret.

Once the project secret has been created, head over to the [Secret Sync](../../../use-platform/secrets/secret-sync) page to learn how to use the project secret data from a Pod.
