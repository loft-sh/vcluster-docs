This document explains how to configure the platform, including its operational settings and features such as SSO login, custom branding, and auditing.

## Understand platform configuration {#understanding-platform-configuration}

The platform is configured through the `vcluster-platform` Helm chart, which comes from the [loft-sh/loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart) repository. The default configuration values can be found in the chart's [values.yaml](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/blob/master/chart/values.yaml) file.

### Types of platform configuration {#types-of-platform-configuration}

The platform's `values.yaml` file contains multiple configuration sections:

1. **Installation settings** - Control how the platform is deployed
   - Top-level fields in the `vcluster-platform` chart's `values.yaml`
   - Located in the platform Helm chart ([loft-sh/loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart))
   - Examples: `replicaCount`, `resources`, `ingress`, `persistence`, etc.
   - These configure Kubernetes deployment aspects like resources and replicas

<!-- vale off -->
2. **Operational settings** - Control how the platform functions after deployment
   - These are grouped under the `config:` section of the `vcluster-platform` chart
   - Located in the platform Helm chart ([loft-sh/loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart))
   - Examples: `config.auth`, `config.audit`, `config.loftHost`
   - Can also be managed through the UI in **Admin > Config**
<!-- vale on -->

3. **Agent settings** - Control how the [platform agent](#the-platform-agent) operates in connected clusters
   - Set through the top-level `agentValues:` section of the `vcluster-platform` chart
   - Located in the platform Helm chart ([loft-sh/loft](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/tree/master/chart))
   - Can be overridden per-cluster with annotations

### Difference between values.yaml and config section {#understanding-the-difference}

When configuring the platform, it's important to understand the difference between the main `values.yaml` settings and the `config` section inside it:

- **values.yaml (installation settings)** - Controls **how** the platform itself is installed
  - Affects the Kubernetes resources created during installation
  - Examples: replica count, resource limits, persistence settings, ingress configuration
  - These options are typically set once during deployment
  - Not accessible through the UI after installation
  - Requires a Helm upgrade to change after initial deployment

<!-- vale off -->
- **config section** - Controls **what** the platform does after installation
  - Located in the `vcluster-platform` chart's `values.yaml` as the `config:` key
  - Defined in [loft-sh/loft/chart/values.yaml](https://github.com/loft-sh/loft/blob/07ee94fecd7265607f6c4a3ec42b14d3ef87391f/chart/values.yaml#L167)
  - Stores settings in a dedicated Kubernetes resource that persists across platform upgrades
  - Contains settings that the platform reads and applies at runtime
  - Affects the platform's behavior, features, and integrations
  - Examples: authentication options, audit settings, UI customization
  - Can be changed any time through the UI in **Admin > Config**
  - Changes are detected and applied without requiring a restart or redeployment
<!-- vale on -->

#### Common configuration tasks {#common-configuration-tasks}

For common tasks, here's which part to configure:

| Task | Configuration location | Example |
|------|------------------------|---------|
| Setting admin credentials | `admin:` section (top-level) | `admin.username`, `admin.password` |
| Configuring replicas for HA | `replicaCount:` (top-level) | `replicaCount: 2` |
| Setting up ingress | `ingress:` section (top-level) | `ingress.enabled: true` |
| Configuring auth providers | `config.auth:` section | `config.auth.github` |
| Setting custom domain | `config:` section | `config.loftHost` |
| Resource limits | `resources:` section (top-level) | `resources.limits.memory` |

### Platform configuration example {#platform-configuration-example}

Here's an example of a platform `values.yaml` file showing all these configuration sections:

```yaml title="Platform values.yaml structure"
# Installation settings (top-level)
replicaCount: 2
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 512Mi
    cpu: 400m

# Admin user settings (top-level)
admin:
  create: true
  username: my-admin-user
  password: my-secure-password

# Ingress configuration (top-level)
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: platform.example.com

# Agent settings (top-level)
agentValues:
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: 256Mi

# Operational settings (inside config section)
config:
  loftHost: platform.example.com
  audit:
    enabled: true
  auth:
    github:
      clientId: $CLIENT_ID
```

## Apply configuration {#applying-configuration}

<!-- vale off -->
The platform configuration can be applied in two ways:
- Through `helm` values when installing or upgrading the platform
- Through the UI in **Admin > Config** after installation (operational settings only)
<!-- vale on -->

Using `helm` values allows you to manage configuration declaratively and enables deployment through [GitOps solutions](../install/gitops) such as ArgoCD.

Here's an example of applying platform configuration with `helm`:

```bash title="Apply configuration with Helm"
RELEASE_NAME=vcluster-platform
RELEASE_NAMESPACE=vcluster-platform
PLATFORM_VERSION='' # Set this to a specific version or leave empty for latest

helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME vcluster-platform \
  --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace $RELEASE_NAMESPACE \
  --create-namespace \
  --values values.yaml \
  ${PLATFORM_VERSION:+--version $PLATFORM_VERSION}
```

## Set a custom domain {#setting-a-custom-domain}

A critical configuration setting is the `loftHost` variable, which defines the domain where users access the platform.

### When to set this value {#when-to-set-this-value}

Set the `loftHost` value after:
1. Installing the platform
2. Configuring TLS certificates
3. Setting up ingress with a [custom domain](./domain.mdx)

### What to set {#what-to-set}

The `loftHost` value should be:
- The same hostname specified in your ingress resource
- Only the hostname (e.g., `platform.example.com`)
- Not contain protocols (e.g., no `https://`)
- Not contain subpaths (e.g., no `/platform`)

```yaml title="Setting a custom domain"
config:
  loftHost: platform.example.com
```

### After changing the domain {#after-changing-the-domain}

After updating the `loftHost` value, you must reconnect all clusters to the platform by running the same connection commands in each Kubernetes context. See [connecting clusters](../administer/clusters/connect-cluster.mdx) for detailed instructions.

:::info Important
Clusters must also be reconnected if you change the `additionalCA` or `insecureSkipVerify` values after the initial setup.
:::

## Manage sensitive information {#managing-sensitive-information}

Many configuration options require sensitive information such as API keys or tokens. Rather than storing these directly in your `values.yaml` file, you can use environment variable placeholders.

### Use secret references {#using-secret-references}

To securely provide sensitive information, store it in a Kubernetes secret and reference it in your configuration:

```yaml title="Securely managing sensitive configuration"
# Secret references
envValueFrom:
  CLIENT_ID:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: github-auth-secret
      key: client_id
  CLIENT_SECRET:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: github-auth-secret
      key: client_secret

# Platform configuration
config:
  auth:
    github:
      clientId: $CLIENT_ID
      clientSecret: $CLIENT_SECRET
      redirectURI: https://my-platform.example.com/auth/github/callback
```

## Custom HTTP headers {#custom-http-headers}

You can configure the platform to add custom HTTP headers to all API responses. This is useful for security-related headers or when integrating with specific environments.

```yaml title="Adding custom HTTP headers"
config:
  auth:
    customHttpHeaders:
      X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
      X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
      Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

## Certificate management {#certificate-management}

### Use a custom certificate authority {#using-a-custom-certificate-authority}

If you want all virtual clusters to trust a specific certificate authority when communicating with the platform, you can configure it centrally rather than in each individual virtual cluster.

:::info Prerequisite
Before setting a custom certificate authority, you must [configure TLS for the platform](/platform/configure/domain#configure-tls).
:::

```yaml title="Setting a custom certificate authority"
# Base64-encoded CA certificate - top-level setting, not inside config:
additionalCA: "(base64 encoded CA)"
```

### Import existing virtual clusters with certificate validation {#importing-existing-virtual-clusters}

When importing externally managed virtual clusters, you can enable secure communication by using the same certificate authority:

1. Get the current certificate authority from your platform:

```bash title="Get the certificate authority value"
helm get values --namespace $RELEASE_NAMESPACE $RELEASE_NAME --all | grep additionalCA
```

2. Import the virtual cluster with certificate validation:

```bash title="Import a virtual cluster with certificate validation"
vcluster platform add vcluster <VCLUSTER_NAME> \
--namespace=<VCLUSTER_NAMESPACE> \
--project=<PROJECT_NAME> \
--ca-data <BASE64_CA_VALUE>
```

The imported virtual cluster restarts and report `Ready` once it establishes a secure connection to the platform.

## The platform agent {#the-platform-agent}

### What is the platform agent? {#what-is-the-platform-agent}

The platform agent is a component that runs in each connected Kubernetes cluster. It handles:
- Cluster resource management
- Communication with the platform
- Reconciliation of cluster-scoped resources

Every cluster connected to the platform, including the cluster where the platform itself runs, must have the platform agent installed.

### Default agent deployment {#default-agent-deployment}

By default, the platform automatically installs the agent in:
1. The cluster where the platform is deployed
2. Any new clusters connected to the platform

### Disable automatic agent deployment {#disabling-automatic-agent-deployment}

In some environments, particularly those using GitOps tools, you might want to manage agent deployment manually. There are two ways to disable automatic agent deployment:

1. **Platform-wide** - Disable for all clusters:

```yaml title="Disable automatic agent deployment platform-wide"
# Not inside config: section - this is a top-level setting
env:
  DISABLE_AGENT: true
```

2. **Per-cluster** - Disable for specific clusters by setting the `loft.sh/cluster-ignore-agent` annotation to `true` on the Cluster resource.

:::warning Agent required
Even if you disable automatic deployment, the platform agent is still required in every connected cluster. You must deploy it manually or through GitOps tools.
:::

### Manual agent installation {#manual-agent-installation}

To manually install the platform agent:

```bash title="Manual agent installation"
RELEASE_NAME=vcluster-platform
RELEASE_NAMESPACE=vcluster-platform
PLATFORM_VERSION='' # Set this to a specific version or leave empty for latest

helm upgrade $RELEASE_NAME vcluster-platform \
  --install \
  --repo https://charts.loft.sh/ \
  --namespace $RELEASE_NAMESPACE \
  --create-namespace \
  --set agentOnly=true \
  ${PLATFORM_VERSION:+--version $PLATFORM_VERSION}
```

## Agent configuration {#agent-configuration}

### Understand agent values {#understanding-agent-values}

The platform agent uses its own set of configuration values, which can be specified in several ways:

1. **Default behavior**: By default, the agent inherits values from the platform configuration
2. **Global agent values**: The `agentValues:` section in the platform `values.yaml` specifies default values for all agents
3. **Cluster-specific values**: The `loft.sh/agent-values` annotation on a Cluster resource overrides global values for that specific cluster

When the platform upgrades an agent, it uses the values from the `agentValues` section (or from the cluster annotation if present).

### Configure the agent through the platform {#configuring-the-agent-through-the-platform}

To customize the agent configuration when it's deployed by the platform, use the `agentValues` section in your platform configuration:

```yaml title="Customizing agent configuration"
# Agent-specific configuration - top-level setting, not in config: section
agentValues:
  # Configure security context for the agent
  securityContext:
    enabled: true

  # Set resource limits for the agent
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 512Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi
```

### Cluster-specific agent configuration {#cluster-specific-agent-configuration}

To apply different configuration to the agent in specific clusters, set the `loft.sh/agent-values` annotation on the Cluster resource. These values override any settings from the platform's `agentValues`.

## Configuration reference {#configuration-reference}
