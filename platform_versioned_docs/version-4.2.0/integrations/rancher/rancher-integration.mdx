Once Rancher is configured on vCluster Platform, virtual clusters can be imported into Rancher and started using as a cluster in Rancher. In order to enable this integration on each virtual cluster, the vCluster Platform project must be enabled with the Rancher integration first. 

## Enable Rancher Integration on a vCluster Platform project

### Limitations

Only one Rancher project can be connected to a single vCluster Platform project. You should not configure a Rancher project to connect to multiple vCluster Platform projects, as the integration will not work in that case.

### Using the UI

Before being able to enable virtual clusters with the Rancher integration, it must be enabled on the project. When vCluster Platform projects are enabled with Rancher integration, a label `loft.sh/loft-project-name: <VCLUSTER_PLATFORM_PROJECT_NAME>` is added to the Rancher project resource. 

<Flow id="rancher-project-setup">
  <Step>
    In the settings of a project, click <NavStep>Rancher</NavStep> and toggle the <Label>Enable Rancher Integration</Label> switch to enable synchronization for this project. Additional configuration options will appear.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Input the <Label>Rancher Project ID</Label> and <Label>Rancher Cluster ID</Label> of the Rancher project you want to connect. Note that these are the IDs and are different from the project name and cluster name. The cluster ID has a `c-x-xxxx` format and the project ID has a `p-xxxx` format. 
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <b>[Optional]</b> Toggle the <Label>Enable Member Synchronization</Label> switch if you wish to sync the Rancher project member roles into vCluster Platform's project member roles.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click <Button>Save Changes</Button> to save the vCluster Platform project settings.
  </Step>
</Flow>

:::info Finding your Rancher Project and Cluster IDs
To find the <Label>Rancher Cluster ID</Label>, in the Rancher UI, click 'Cluster Management' in the left side menu, and then select the desired cluster, click the ellipsis button on the right side and select <Label>View YAML</Label>. The <code>metadata.name</code> is the Cluster ID. 

To get the <Label>Rancher Project ID</Label>, in the Rancher UI, click 'Cluster Management' in the left side menu, click <Button>Explore</Button> on the cluster that has the project you want to connect to. In the cluster explorer, click  <NavStep>Projects/Namespaces</NavStep> in the cluster navigation. Click the ellipsis button on the right side of the desired project name and select the <Label>View YAML</Label> option. The <code>metadata.name</code> is the <Label>Rancher Project ID</Label>.
:::

### On the Project Resource

If you are creating a project resource into vCluster Platform directly, you can configure the Rancher integration directly on the <code>projects.managementv1.loft.sh</code> resource.

## Managing Virtual Clusters in Rancher UI

### Creating a virtual cluster in the Rancher UI

<Flow id="rancher-plugin-create-vcluster">
  <Step>
    In the Rancher home page, click the <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter a name for the virtual cluster and select the Rancher project in which you wish to create the virtual cluster. Only those projects which have the Rancher Integration enabled are displayed in the list.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the <Button>Create</Button> button which will take you to the <Label>Create VirtualClusterInstance</Label> page in the vCluster Platform to get ready to create a virtual cluster.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click the <Label>Rancher</Label> configuration tab.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Slide the <Label>Add to Rancher</Label> toggle to enable.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Create</Button>button once you have configured the rest of the virtual cluster as per your preference.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Navigate back to the Rancher UI and the virtual cluster should be available and in <Label>Active</Label> state.
  </Step>
</Flow>

### Deleting a virtual cluster in the Rancher UI

<Flow id="rancher-plugin-delete-vcluster">
  <Step>
    In the Rancher home page, click the Delete icon for the virtual cluster you want to delete.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    You will be re-directed to the VirtualClusterInstance Page in the vCluster Platform UI for confirmation.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Click on the <Button>Delete</Button> to confirm in the vCluster Platform UI. The virtual cluster will be deleted from Rancher.
  </Step>
</Flow>

## Importing Virtual Clusters into Rancher through vCluster Platform UI

Once a vCluster Platform project has the Rancher integration enabled, virtual clusters within that project are eligible to be
synced into Rancher as an imported cluster in Rancher UI. In the vCluster Platform UI, you can enable virtual cluster import into Rancher during the virtual cluster creation step, or by enabling this feature on existing
virtual clusters.

:::info Make Sure Your Project Has Rancher Enabled
If the project does *not* have Rancher integration enabled, you
will not see the "Add to Rancher" options in the virtual cluster configuration.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="creation"
    values={[
        {label: 'During Virtual Cluster Creation', value: 'creation'},
        {label: 'On Existing Virtual Cluster', value: 'existing'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="creation">
        <Flow id="enable-rancher-import-creation">
            <Step>
                In the vCluster Platform UI, select a project that has Rancher integration enabled. 
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Click on Virtual Clusters and the <Button>Create Virtual Cluster</Button> button.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                In the popup, optionally select the virtual cluster template, then click the
                <Button>Configure</Button> button.
            </Step>
            <Step>
                Click the <Label>Rancher</Label> configuration tab.
            </Step>
            <Step>

            </Step>
            <Step>
                Finish configuring anything else you'd like on your virtual cluster, then click the
                <Button>Create</Button> button. The virtual cluster is created in vCluster Platform and imported into Rancher.
            </Step>

            </Step>
            <Step>
                Find your desired virtual cluster in the virtual cluster list. Slide the
                <Label>Add to Rancher</Label> slider to import the virtual cluster into Rancher.
            </Step>
        </Flow>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Hiding Nodes in Rancher

Since virtual clusters are not using physical nodes, you can hide the nodes from Rancher in order for the
virtual nodes to not be counted in your Rancher node count. In order to hide the nodes of your virtual cluster, you need to enable our Rancher nodeless plugin on the virtual cluster. 

Add the plugin to your `vcluster.yaml` configuration.

```yaml
plugins:
  rancher:
    image: ghcr.io/loft-sh/rancher-nodeless-plugin:0.0.5
```

:::tip Use Templates for plugins
You can enforce that all virtual clusters enable the plugin by enforcing template usage in the project.

##  Disabling Rancher Integration

You may disable the Rancher integration at a per virtual cluster or per project level by toggling the same sliders
used to enable it. Disabling the integration at the virtual cluster level simply removes the virtual cluster from the Rancher UI, but the virtual cluster is still running.

Disabling the integration at the project level removes **all** virtual clusters from Rancher, so be careful
when disabling at this level.
