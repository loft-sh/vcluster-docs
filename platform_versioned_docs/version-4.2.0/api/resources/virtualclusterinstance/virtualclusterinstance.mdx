A virtual cluster is a fully functional Kubernetes cluster that runs inside the namespace of another Kubernetes cluster (host cluster). Virtual clusters are very useful if you are hitting the limits of namespaces and do not want to make special exceptions to the multi-tenancy configuration of the underlying cluster, e.g. a user needs their own CRD or user needs pods from 2 namespaces to communicate with each other but your standard NetworkPolicy does not allow this, then a virtual cluster may be perfect for this user.

## Virtual Cluster example

An example Virtual Cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: VirtualClusterInstance
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: my-virtual-cluster
  namespace: loft-p-my-project
spec:
  clusterRef: {}
  displayName: my-display-name
  owner:
    user: my-user
  parameters: 'my-parameter: my-value'
  templateRef:
    name: my-virtual-cluster-template
status: {}

```

### Verbs

The platform supports two categories of verbs that define what actions users can perform on resources. These categories determine how permissions are granted:

- **Standard verbs** map directly to Kubernetes API operations with corresponding HTTP methods.
- **Non-standard verbs** require explicit RBAC policy assignments.

The `verbs` array in the `access` object specifies which operations users and teams can perform on virtual cluster instances.

<summary>Verbs for Virtual Cluster Instances </summary>

The following table lists the verbs for the `VirtualClusterInstance` resource, including their HTTP methods, descriptions, and category.

| Verb       | HTTP Method   | Description    | Type         |
|--------- --|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| `get`      | GET           | Retrieves virtual cluster instance from UI and API                          | Standard     |
| `list`     | GET           | Lists collections of virtual cluster instances                              | Standard     |
| `watch`    | GET with `?watch=1` | Watches for changes to virtual cluster instances                      | Standard     |
| `create`          | POST                | Creates new virtual cluster instances                          | Standard     |
| `update`          | PATCH               | Updates existing virtual cluster instances from UI             | Standard     |
| `patch`           | PATCH               | Partially modifies resources via API                           | Standard     |
| `delete`          | DELETE              | Deletes resources from UI and API                              | Standard     |
| `deletecollection`| DELETE with filters | Deletes resources by criteria (e.g., label selector)           | Standard     |
| `use`             | N/A                 | Manages access to vcluster API, kubeconfig, and resources      | Non-standard |
