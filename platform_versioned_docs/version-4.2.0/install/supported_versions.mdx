The following defines the platform's lifecycle policy for releases and maintenance.

The platform aims to release on a regular cadence and follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We encourage users to run the latest stable release
to stay up to date on features and security patches.

Due to the rapid development of the platform, each minor version is actively supported for 3 months after it's been released. At the end of active support, the version moves into maintenance support. During active support, any updates on the active development branch can
be backported upon request. During maintenance support, backporting is limited only to security updates.

Any previous versions which are not on this list are no longer in any support window.

## Platform supported versions

| Release | Released | Active Support End Date | Maintenance Support End Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| v4.2 | December 17, 2024 | June 17, 2025 | September 17, 2025 |
| v4.1 | November 12, 2024 | February 12, 2025 | May 12, 2025 |
| v4.0 | October 15, 2024 | January 15, 2025 | April 15, 2025 |
| v3.4| February 29, 2024 | April 1, 2025* | July 1, 2025 |

\* Due to the number of breaking changes from vCluster v0.19 to v0.20 and Platform v3.4 to v4.0, v3.4 has an extended active support end date. Review the [migration guide](../reference/migrations/4-0-migration.mdx) to upgrade your v3.4 to v4.0 Platform.
