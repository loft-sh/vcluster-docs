This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the platform on [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:
<BasePrerequisites />
- vCluster CLI <InstallCli />
- [Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` CLI)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
  :::note
  Ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions to create clusters and manage cloud services.
  :::

## Create GKE cluster

<Flow id="create-gke-cluster">

<Step>
Prepare the environment.

Start by creating a zonal GKE cluster using the `gcloud` CLI. First, set up your environment variables:

:::tip
Project ID can be found in the Google Cloud Console under the project name.
Alternatively use `gcloud project list` to list all projects and their IDs.
To check which project is active, use `gcloud config get-value project`.
:::

```bash title="Set environment variables"
export PROJECT_ID=development
export CLUSTER_NAME=vcluster-demo
export ZONE=europe-west1-b
export MACHINE_TYPE=e2-standard-4
```

Configure `gcloud` and enable the required APIs and set default project:

```bash title="Configure gcloud"
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
```
</Step>

<Step>
Create the cluster.

```bash title="Create GKE cluster"
gcloud container clusters create $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --zone $ZONE \
    --machine-type $MACHINE_TYPE \
    --num-nodes 2
```

  :::info
  This process typically takes about 10-15 minutes.
  :::

This command creates a GKE cluster named vcluster-demo in the europe-west1-b
zone with two nodes of type e2-standard-4.

<KubeconfigUpdate />

</Step>

<Step>
Verify the cluster creation.

Verify that the GKE was created successfully by listing the nodes:

```bash title="List cluster nodes"
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see output similar to:
```
NAME           LOCATION        MASTER_VERSION      MASTER_IP      MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION        NUM_NODES  STATUS
vcluster-demo  europe-west1-b  1.30.5-gke.1443001  35.187.66.218  e2-standard-4  1.30.5-gke.1443001  2          RUNNING
```

</Step>

</Flow>

## Platform setup

With the GKE cluster up and running, you can now deploy the platform in a few
easy steps.

<Flow>

### Install the platform

<Step>
Deploy platform using the vCluster CLI.

Now that you have vCluster running on GKE, set up the [platform
](/platform/install/quick-start-guide) and configure GPC in the following steps.

Easiest way to deploy a platform is using the `vcluster CLI`

:::note idempotency
Please note that the command is _idempotent_, meaning that running it again does
not result it creating another cluster with the same name.
:::

```bash title="deploy the platform using vcluster cli
vcluster platform start
```
The command asks you for providing email address for the admin user

```bash title="deployment expected output"
By providing your email, you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Statement:
Terms of Service: https://www.loft.sh/legal/terms
Privacy Statement: https://www.loft.sh/legal/privacy
? Please specify an email address for the admin user
```

:::tip retry
If the command takes to long to execute, for example due to other cluster
operations, simply run the command one more time
:::
</Step>

<Step>
Connect to the platform.

Once the platform is deployed, default browser with the platform UI opens and you should see the output similar to this:

```bash title="platform deployment output"
##########################   LOGIN   ############################

Username: admin
Password: 9758c908-b931-4edd-b3cb-3f034e50651a  # Change via UI or via: vcluster platform reset password

Login via UI:  https://hyx4907.loft.host
Login via CLI: vcluster platform login https://hyx4907.loft.host

#################################################################

vCluster Platform was successfully installed and can now be reached at: https://hyx4907.loft.host

Thanks for using vCluster Platform!
19:34:46 done You are successfully logged into vCluster Platform!
- Use `vcluster platform create vcluster` to create a new virtual cluster
- Use `vcluster platform add vcluster` to add an existing virtual cluster to a vCluster platform instance
```

When logging in via UI, provide: <Label>First Name</Label>, <Label>Last Name</Label>, <Label>Email</Label> (should default to
the one supplied earlier) and <Label>Organization</Label>.

To login via CLI, simply copy/pasted the `Login via CLI` command.

This is the basic platform deployment, from there you can refer to the [Next
steps seciton](#post-install-steps) to learn about platform features.

There are a few additional **optional** configuration steps that can be done.

- [Expose platform UI via load balancer](#load-balancer)
- [Setup custom domain and configure DNS](#setup-domain-dns)
</Step>

</Flow>

<Flow>

### [Optional] expose platform UI via load balancer {#load-balancer}

<Step>
Create a LoadBalancer service to expose the platform UI.

:::note
Please note that this
assumes the platform is deployed in the `vcluster-platform` namespace which is a
default deployment namespace.
:::

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: vcluster-platform-loadbalancer
  namespace: vcluster-platform
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  selector:
    app: loft
  ports:
  - name: https
    protocol: TCP
    port: 443
    targetPort: 10443
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step>
Once the service is active, obtain the external IP address:

```bash
kubectl get svc vcluster-platform-loadbalancer -n vcluster-platform
```

and navigate to the IP address in your browser `https://<EXTERNAL_IP>`.

:::tip certificate
Note that the platform uses a self-signed certificate, so you need to
accept the warning in your browser. For production use, you should [replace the certificate with a valid one.](/platform/configure/domain#configure-tls)
:::

</Step>

</Flow>

<Flow>

### [Optional] setup custom domain and configure DNS {#setup-domain-dns}

<Step>
Configure DNS in Google Cloud DNS.
To use a custom domain, you need to configure the DNS to point to the LoadBalancer IP address.

```bash title="Configure DNS"
EXTERNAL_IP="provide the load balancer external IP"

gcloud dns managed-zones create vcluster-platform --dns-name="yourdomain.tld."

gcloud dns record-sets transaction start --zone=vcluster-platform

gcloud dns record-sets transaction add "${EXTERNAL_IP}" \
    --name="vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld." \
    --ttl=300 \
    --type=A \
    --zone=vcluster-platform

gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute --zone=vcluster-platform
```
</Step>

<Step>
Connect the platform to the custom domain.

Once the DNS is setup, the platform can be started with the command `vcluster
platform start --host=vcluster-platform.yourdomain.tld`

:::info
Read more about how to configure a custom [domain](/platform/configure/domain).

If you do not have a custom domain setup, [follow this
tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/tutorials/create-domain-tutorial).
:::

</Step>

</Flow>

## Next steps {#post-install-steps}

<InstallNextSteps />

You can also use Google as identity provider and [configure SSO ](/platform/configure/single-sign-on/providers/google)to enable user
authentication to the platform.

## Cleanup

If you deployed the GKE cluster with this tutorial, and want to clean up the resources, run the
following command:

```bash title="Clean up resources"
gcloud container clusters delete $CLUSTER_NAME --zone $ZONE --quiet
```
