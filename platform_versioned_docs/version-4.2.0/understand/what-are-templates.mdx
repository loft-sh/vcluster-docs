Templates can be created for various resources (i.e. virtual clusters or spaces), that can be used when creating the resource. All the options available in resource creation is available in the template.

Templates are a great way for admins to control what configuration options they want to out to end users. Some examples of usage of templates:
* Creating standard developer environment for a
given team or organization
* Creating pre-built environments to be used in continuous
integration and testing

Templates can include settings such as:

- Isolation relevant objects, such as resource quotas, limit ranges and network policies.
- Kubernetes objects (including CRDs for virtual clusters). This could include development tooling, pre-populated databases with test data, or any other useful resources.
- Custom defined [Apps](what-are-apps.mdx)

## Allow templates in projects

Templates are created at a global level, but to use a template, they need to be given permission to be allowed in a given project.
