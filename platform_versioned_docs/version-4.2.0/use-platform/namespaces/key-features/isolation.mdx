Namespaces can be configured to provide moderate levels of isolation. This "isolation"
typically includes applying ResourceQuotas, LimitRanges, and NetworkPolicies to a Namespace. These
policies can be configured using the Namespace `Objects` option, to provide your desired quotas,
limits and network policies. To make your life easier, Loft is deployed with a default Namespace
Template called `Isolated Namespace Template`. This namespace template can give you a head start on
configuring your own Namespace isolation policies, or you may find the template sufficient for your
needs.

The default `Isoalted Namespace Template` creates hard limits for resource types, sets rational
default limit ranges, and deploys a rather restrictive NetworkPolicy limiting network traffic.

:::warning CNIs and Network Policies
Not all CNIs will support all network policies. Make sure you understand what capabilities your
CNI supports when investigating namespace isolation.
