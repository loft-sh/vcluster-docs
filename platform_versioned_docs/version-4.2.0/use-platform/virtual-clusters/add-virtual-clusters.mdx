Any running virtual cluster can be added to the platform. When adding a virtual cluster to the platform, the virtual cluster must be added to a designated project and when the virtual
cluster is added to the platform, a `VirtualClusterInstance` resource is created in the platform.

        **Add Host Cluster to the Platform (Optional)**: If you want to add the host cluster to the platform, then
        run this command. Before running this command, be sure that your kubecontext is set to the
        host cluster.


        ```bash title="Connect host cluster to platform."
        CLUSTER_ID=my-host-cluster
        UI_CLUSTER_NAME="My Host Cluster"
        vcluster platform add cluster $CLUSTER_ID --display-name $UI_CLUSTER_NAME
        ```

      </Step>
      <Step>
      **Adding Virtual Cluster to the Platform**: Before running this command, be sure that your kubecontext is set to the
            host cluster running the vcluster that you want to add.

        ```bash title="Add vcluster to the platform in a project."
      VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_ID=my-vcluster
    PROJECT=default
    VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_IMPORT_NAME="My vCluster"
    vcluster platform add vcluster $VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_ID \
      --project $PROJECT
      --import-name $VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_IMPORT_NAME
        ```
