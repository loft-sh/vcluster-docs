vCluster Platform lets you manage your virtual clusters and users across your Kubernetes clusters.

## Platform features

The vCluster Platform provides a single pane of glass that lets you connect your clusters, deploy virtual clusters, configure user access, and reduce operational costs.

### Projects

Projects are the highest organizational unit that vCluster Platform uses. They
help logically group resources by team or division, and as a container to apply
role based access controls (RBAC). Projects are central part of your vCluster
Platform experience, so make sure to read more about them in the [Projects
section](/platform/understand/what-are-projects).

### Clusters

vCluster Platform is installed into, and can connect to, as many physical Kubernetes clusters as you need to manage. vCluster Platform can then be used to manage workloads in each of the physical clusters, deploying spaces, virtual clusters, and apps as needed. vCluster Platform provides granular role based access control (RBAC) allowing for vCluster Platform administrators to limit which users and teams have access to which clusters, as well as much more granular control at the project, space, and virtual cluster levels. Read more about vCluster Platform integration with physical clusters in the [Clusters section ](understand/what-are-clusters.mdx).

### Virtual clusters

Virtual clusters are _virtual_ Kubernetes clusters. These virtual clusters run inside a namespace within the "parent" or "host" physical cluster, thereby allowing administrators to effectively create many Kubernetes instance in a single instance -- ideal for development, testing, and even production workloads. See the [Virtual Clusters section](understand/what-are-virtual-clusters.mdx) for details.

### Apps

Apps allow users to define applications that users can then be empowered to deploy in clusters, spaces, and virtual clusters they have appropriate access to. The idea here is nothing new, however, vCluster Platform's Apps interface allows for easily packaging applications, and critically, exposing parameters that users can then select or input at deployment time. Apps can be specified via Kubernetes Manifests,
bash scripts, Helm charts, etc. See the [Apps section](understand/what-are-apps.mdx), and be sure to learn about [versioning](administer/templates/versioning.mdx) and [parameters](administer/templates/parameters.mdx).

### Cost reduction tools

vCluster Platform provides features to reduce Kubernetes costs.

- Sleep mode

  Put Kubernetes namespaces to sleep. vCluster Platform sets `replicas: 0` for all replica-controlled resources such as `Deployments` and `StatefulSets`. This means that Kubernetes will delete all pods but the entire configuration of resources within the namespace is still there. Sleep mode can be:

  - Invoked manually
  - Triggered by an inactivity timeout (no one has run a `kubectl` command in this namespace for X
minutes)
  - Scheduled using a CRON syntax


- Auto delete inactive virtual clusters

  Configure an auto-delete for virtual clusters that have not been used for a
  certain period of time (inactivity). See [Sleep Mode](use-platform/namespaces/key-features/sleep-mode.mdx) for details.


- Inactivity Detection

  All requests that are made through vCluster Platform count as activity in the namespace.

      fontSize: '12px'

      <div style={{paddingLeft: '1em'}}>name: my-pod</div>
      <div>...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

  If your kube-context points to vCluster Platform's API server as a proxy before the actual connected cluster's API server, every `kubectl` request will be an activity and reset the inactivity timeout.
