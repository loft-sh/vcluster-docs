To update the platform deployment to use the NGINX ingress controller, create a simple values
file that tells the platform to do just that. If you created a values file during your initial
deployment, you can simply edit that file, if you did not, you can create a new file with the
following contents.

```yaml title="Update to use NGINX ingress controller"
ingress:
  enabled: true
  host: "vcluster-platform.mydomain.tld" # Make sure to change this
  ingressClass: "nginx" # Optional, nginx is default value!
```
