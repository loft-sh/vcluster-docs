- Allow egress traffic from vCluster Platform pods to https://admin.loft.sh/* (HTTPS, port 443) to enable license retrieval and validation. For air-gapped setups, refer to the [air-gapped environment guide](/docs/platform/install/advanced/air-gapped).
- Ensure that the required network ports are open.

    :::info  
    The platform requires open ports for API extensions, webhooks, and cost monitoring. In the infrastructure of private Kubernetes clusters, ensure firewall rules allow traffic from the Kubernetes master to platform components.  
    :::

    - `8443` – API service extension for cluster communication (`v1.cluster.loft.sh`)  
    - `9443` – Webhook validation and enforcement (`loft webhook`)  
    - `9444` – Management API for platform administration (`v1.management.loft.sh`)  
    - `9090` – Prometheus metrics proxy for cost monitoring  

    For more information, see [Networking](/docs/platform/administer/clusters/advanced/networking) to learn about port and firewall rules.
