**Create A GitHub App**

GitHub Apps allow external services to authenticate users through GitHub's OAuth system. To set up SSO for the platform, create a new OAuth App in GitHub:

- Navigate to `Settings > Developer Settings > OAuth Apps` in GitHub.
- Click on [Create a new OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
- Configure the OAuth App with the following settings:

   - Application name: Platform Login via GitHub
   - Homepage URL: `https://$VCLUSTER_PRO_HOSTNAME`
   - Authorization callback URL: `https://$VCLUSTER_PRO_HOSTNAME/auth/github/callback`

- After creating the app, note the `$GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `$GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`. These is required in the next step.

:::info
Replace `$VCLUSTER_PRO_HOSTNAME` with your actual platform hostname.

**Create platform config for GitHub**

To enable GitHub SSO for the platform, update the configuration:

- Navigate to `Admin > Config` in the platform interface.
- Adjust your configuration as shown below:

```yaml title="GitHub SSO Configuration"
auth:
  # Tell loft to use github authentication
  github:
    #
    #
    # REQUIRED CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # ClientID of the github application. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientId: $GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
    # ClientSecret of the github application. Can be string literal or pulled from the environment.
    clientSecret: $GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
    # Callback URL in the form of https://your-loft-domain/auth/github/callback
    redirectURI: https://vcluster-platform.my.domain/auth/github/callback
    #
    #
    # OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION
    #
    #
    # (Optional) vCluster Platform queries the following organizations for group information.
	# Group claims are formatted as "(org):(team)".
	# For example if a user is part of the "engineering" team of the "coreos"
	# org, the group claim would include "coreos:engineering".
	#
	# If orgs are specified in the config then user MUST be a member of at least one
	# of the specified orgs to authenticate with loft.
	orgs:
	  # Organization name in github (not slug, full name)
	- name: My Organization
	  # (Optional) Names of teams in a github organization. A user will be able to
	  # authenticate if they are members of at least one of these teams.
	  teams:
	  - myteam
    # (Optional) Required ONLY for GitHub Enterprise.
    # This is the Hostname of the GitHub Enterprise account listed on the
	# management console.
    hostName: my-github.org
    # (Optional) Required ONLY for GitHub Enterprise.
    # Used to support self-signed or untrusted CA root certificates.
    rootCA: /certs/github.ca
```

Configuration options explained:

- `clientId`: The Client ID from the GitHub OAuth App.
- `clientSecret`: The Client Secret from the GitHub OAuth App.
- `redirectURI`: The Authorization callback URL specified in the GitHub OAuth App.
- `orgs`: Specify GitHub organizations and teams allowed to access the platform.
- `hostName`: Custom GitHub Enterprise hostname (if applicable).
- `rootCA`: Path to a custom root certificate for GitHub Enterprise (if applicable).

</Step>
<Step>

**Authenticate via GitHub**

After saving the new configuration, the platform should restart. Users can now log in via GitHub:

- Access the platform login page.
- Click on the "Login with GitHub" option.
- Authenticate with GitHub credentials.
- Grant the requested permissions to the GitHub OAuth App.

:::warning
Users **must** grant access to the organization configured in step 2. Without this access, they are not going to be able to log in.
