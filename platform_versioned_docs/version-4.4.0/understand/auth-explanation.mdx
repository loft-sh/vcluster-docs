# Authentication and authorization 

This guide explains the key security concepts in vCluster Platform and demonstrates how to set up a complete authentication system with role-based permissions.

## Core security concepts

The platform uses several objects to manage access and permissions:

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User** | A person with platform access. Users can have Management Roles assigned directly and can belong to Groups and Teams. [API reference](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/api/resources/user) |
| **SSO Group** | A representation of a group from your [configured SSO provider](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/configure/single-sign-on/overview). These groups are imported during authentication and stored in User records. |
| **Team** | A collection of platform users. Users join teams either through explicit assignment or via SSO Group membership. Teams can have Management Roles. [API reference](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/api/resources/team) |
| **Management Role** | Defines permissions granted to users or teams within specific scopes. [API reference](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/api/resources/clusterroletemplate) |
| **Project** | An organizational unit for resources such as virtual clusters. [Projects](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/understand/what-are-projects) help enforce access control and resource quotas.|

## Setting up authentication with Microsoft Entra ID

This example shows how to implement a comprehensive security model using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Entra ID tenant configured as your identity provider
- vCluster Platform installed and running
- Administrative access to vCluster Platform

### Authentication setup

1. Configure Microsoft Entra ID as your SSO provider using either:
   - [OIDC configuration](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/configure/single-sign-on/providers/microsoft)
   - [SAML configuration](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/configure/single-sign-on/providers/saml)

2. Configure your Entra ID application to include group memberships in authentication tokens

3. Configure vCluster Platform to accept specific groups for platform access

### Define roles for different personas

Create Management Roles aligned with your organization's needs. This example uses four distinct roles:

1. **Platform Operations** - Full platform management permissions
2. **DevOps Engineers** - Create and manage virtual clusters within projects
3. **Developers** - Connect to and use virtual clusters
4. **Automation Service Account** - Programmatic access for GitOps workflows

### Team structure

1. Create Teams that correspond to your organizational structure:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f platform-ops-team.yaml
   kubectl apply -f app-team-devops.yaml
   kubectl apply -f app-team-developers.yaml
   kubectl apply -f gitops-automation-team.yaml
   ```

2. Associate Teams with SSO Groups:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
   kind: Team
   metadata:
     name: app-team-devops
   spec:
     displayName: "Application Team - DevOps"
     description: "DevOps engineers responsible for cluster provisioning"
     groups:
       - name: "app-team-devops@example.com"
   ```

3. Assign appropriate Management Roles to each Team:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
   kind: Team
   metadata:
     name: platform-ops-team
   spec:
     displayName: "Platform Operations"
     clusterRoles:
       - platform-admin
   ```

### Project organization

Create Projects for each application or team:

```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: app-team-project
spec:
  displayName: "Application Team Project"
  description: "Resources for the application team"
  allowedClusters:
    - name: "prod-cluster"
    - name: "dev-cluster"
  quotas:
    virtualClusters: 5
```

### GitOps governance

For organizations requiring additional governance:

1. Manage Projects, Management Roles, and Teams using GitOps workflows
2. Store configurations in a version-controlled repository
3. Use your CI/CD system with the automation service account to apply changes


## Management role example

```yaml
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: ClusterRoleTemplate
metadata:
  name: loft-management-project-admin-custom
  labels:
    loft.sh/project-role: 'true'
spec:
  displayName: Custom Project Admin
  description: >-
    Allows the user or team to manage the project. Gives full access to
    modifying the project and all objects inside it.
  management: true
  access:
    - verbs:
        - get
      users:
        - '*'
  clusterRoleTemplate:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
    rules:
      - verbs:
          - '*'
        apiGroups:
          - management.loft.sh
        resources:
          - virtualclusterinstances
          - virtualclusterinstances/log
          - virtualclusterinstances/kubeconfig
          - virtualclusterinstances/accesskey
          - virtualclusterinstances/restricted
          - projectsecrets
          - projects
          - projects/spec.*
```
