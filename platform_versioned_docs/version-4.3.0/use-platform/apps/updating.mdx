App templates can be <i>versioned</i>. Versioning an App Template allows you to make changes over time to an App
while retaining the current version/iteration. Apps that are deployed from a template with
updated versions will show up with a warning indicating that a newer App version is available.

You can change the version of an installed App in a space, cluster, or virtual cluster to a
newer (or older!) version in the vCluster Platform UI.
