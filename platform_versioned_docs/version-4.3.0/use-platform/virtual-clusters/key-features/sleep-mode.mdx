# Sleep mode and auto delete for virtual clusters

The platform provides two features to reduce Kubernetes costs:

- **Sleep mode** puts virtual clusters to sleep when nobody is using them. This removes all pods while keeping all resources inside the virtual clusters during periods of inactivity.
- **Auto-delete** deletes virtual clusters that have been idle for a while.

Both features rely on the platform's [inactivity detection](#inactivity-detection).

## Work with auto-delete

The platform lets you configure auto-delete for virtual clusters that have not been used for a certain period of time.
