With sleep mode, you can put {props.name}s to sleep which means that
vCluster Platform will set `replicas: 0` for all replica-controlled
resources such as `Deployments` and `StatefulSets`{" "}
inside the {props.name}. This means that Kubernetes will delete all pods but
the entire configuration of resources within the {props.name} is still there.

Sleep mode can be:
<ul>
  <li>Invoked manually</li>
  <li>
    Triggered by an inactivity timeout (no one has run a <code>kubectl</code>{" "}
    command or accessed an ingress in this {props.name} for X minutes)
  </li>
  <li>Scheduled using a CRON syntax</li>
</ul>
