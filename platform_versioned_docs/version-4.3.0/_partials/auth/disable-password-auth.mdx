To turn off password-based authentication, navigate to `Admin > Config` add these two lines to your config:

```yaml {3-4} title="Disable password-based authentication"
auth:
  oidc: ...             # This is your SSO configuration (make sure this is working!)
  password:
    disabled: true      # Disable password-based authentication
```
