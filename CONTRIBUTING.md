# Contribute to the vCluster docs

## Docs website

This docs website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) v3, a modern
static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most
changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
Note that `npm run start` doesn't always catch build errors.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served
using any static contents hosting service.

`npm run serve`

Serves the built website locally.

Note: Before making a pull request, it's recommended to run `npm run serve` to fix
any broken links that may have been introduced.

## Style guide

The vCluster docs use the following style guides in this order:

1. [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
2. Kubernetes [Documentation Style Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/)
for Kubernetes terms.

Page titles follow **sentence** case. Capitalize Kubernetes objects
[according to the K8s style guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/#documentation-formatting-standards).

### Oxford comma

Use the Oxford comma (serial comma) before the last item when listing 3 or more
items in a sentence.

- **Do Not**: vCluster requires a, b and c.

See Scribbr's [article](https://www.scribbr.com/commas/oxford-comma/) on the Oxford
comma for a detailed explanation and examples.
