Enabling this feature deploys [etcd](https://etcd.io/) on the host cluster in the same namespace as the virtual cluster and configures the control plane to use it as the backing store. vCluster deploys etcd with a `StatefulSet`, `Service`, and headless `Service`.
```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
        ...
```

You can customize the `StatefulSet`  that vCluster uses to deploy etcd. One of the more common customizations is to set resource requests:
```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
        statefulSet:
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 20m
              memory: 150Mi
```

Add optional annotations to each etcd component.
```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore:
    etcd:
      deploy:
        enabled: true
        statefulSet:
          annotations:
            app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "etcd"
            cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "false"
        service:
          annotations:
            app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "etcd"
        headlessService:
          annotations:
            app.kubernetes.io/part-of: "etcd"
```

:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, changing the backing store of vCluster is not supported.

### Migrate to embedded etcd

<ProAdmonition />

For vCluster Pro users, it is possible to migrate the backing store of a virtual
cluster from the external to [embedded etcd](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/embedded#embedded) `controlPlane.backingstore.etcd.embedded`.
