At any time, you can upgrade the version of your vCluster. During the upgrade, you can also apply 
configuration option changes. 

<p></p>

:::tip
If you are moving from vCluster 0.19.x to 0.20+, see the [conversion guide](../reference/migrations/0-20-migration) for how to automatically convert your existing `values.yaml` configuration file to the new `vcluster.yaml` format.
:::

## (Optional) Update `vcluster.yaml` 

Update your `vcluster.yaml` to change your configuration options during a vCluster version upgrade.

<p></p>
:::warning 
Remember that you can't change distros or backing store once a vCluster is deployed. 
:::

## Upgrade vCluster Version

These steps assume that you have been a `vcluster.yaml`, but there are variables in the code blocks for you to replace for:

* Name of the virtual cluster
* Namespace of where the virtual cluster is deployed
* Version to upgrade to

<UpgradeVersion />
