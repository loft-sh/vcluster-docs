# Retrieve the deployed vCluster configuration

You can deploy vCluster using tools like Helm, the vCluster CLI, ArgoCD, or other GitOps and automation tools. 
You may need to view the configuration of a running vCluster, especially if the original Helm values or deployment files are unavailable.
This is useful for understanding how the vCluster was set up, debugging issues, or recreating the setup in another environment.

## View the configuration

### Use the vCluster CLI

The recommended way to retrieve the configuration is with the vCluster command line tool using the following command:

```bash
vcluster describe <VCLUSTER NAME> --namespace <VCLUSTER NAMESPACE> -o yaml
```
- Replace `<VCLUSTER NAME>` with the vCluster name.
- Replace `<VCLUSTER NAMESPACE>` with the namespace where the vCluster is running.


### Use kubectl

If you don't have the vCluster CLI available, you can access the configuration directly through kubectl by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec --context=[HOST CONTEXT] -n [VCLUSTER NAMESPACE] [VCLUSTER POD NAME] -it -- cat /var/vcluster/config.yaml
```
- Replace `[HOST_CONTEXT]` with your host cluster context.
- Replace `[VCLUSTER_NAMESPACE]` with the namespace where the vCluster is running.
- Replace `[VCLUSTER_POD_NAME]` with the vCluster controller pod name.
