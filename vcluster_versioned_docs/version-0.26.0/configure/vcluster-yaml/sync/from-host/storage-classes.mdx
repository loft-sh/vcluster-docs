By default, this is disabled.

StorageClass resources define how virtual clusters provision storage. They specify storage backends such as AWS EBS, Azure Disk, or GCP Persistent Disk, along with parameters such as performance tiers and replication settings.

By default, each virtual cluster needs its own StorageClass resources. StorageClass syncing allows virtual clusters to use StorageClass resources from the host cluster instead.

You can enable this feature to sync StorageClass resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. Add labels to StorageClass resources in your host cluster and configure vCluster to sync only those matching specific selectors. When you create a PersistentVolumeClaim that references a synced StorageClass, the host cluster uses that storage configuration. Common use cases include:

- **Cost control**: Restrict access to specific storage classes based on cost or performance characteristics.
- **Compliance**: Control which storage backends and configurations are available to virtual clusters.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Provide different storage options to different teams while preventing access to restricted storage types.
- **Simplified management**: Update storage class configurations in the host cluster rather than in each virtual cluster.
- **Security**: Control access to storage backends and encryption options.
