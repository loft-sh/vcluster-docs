# Configure NVIDIA KAI scheduler with vCluster {#configure-kai-scheduler-with-vcluster}

This guide explains how to configure vCluster to work with the [NVIDIA KAI scheduler](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler). KAI is a Kubernetes scheduler that optimizes resource allocation for both GPU and CPU workloads, with advanced queuing, fractional GPU allocation, and topology awareness.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
<BasePrerequisites />
- KAI scheduler installed in the host cluster

## Understand the challenge {#understand-the-challenge}

By default, when syncing workload pods from a vCluster to the host cluster, vCluster sets ownership references on the synced pods. When using custom schedulers like KAI, this causes issues because:

- KAI's pod-grouper controller watches for pods with `schedulerName: kai-scheduler`
- The pod-grouper controller traverses the owner references to group related pods
- For vCluster workloads, the owner reference is set to the vCluster service in the host namespace
- The pod-grouper may not have sufficient permissions to access these Service resources

## Solution: Disable owner references in vCluster {#solution-disable-owner-references}

To solve this issue, configure vCluster to not set owner references on synced pods using the [`experimental.syncSettings.setOwner`](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/experimental/sync-settings#syncSettings-setOwner) option. This simple approach allows the KAI scheduler to work with vCluster pods without requiring any modifications to the scheduler itself.

Add the following to your vCluster configuration (`values.yaml` for Helm or vCluster config):

```yaml title="Disable owner references in vCluster config"
# highlight-start
experimental:
  syncSettings:
    setOwner: false
# highlight-end
```

Apply this configuration when creating or updating your vCluster:

```bash title="Create vCluster with disabled owner references"
vcluster create my-vcluster --set experimental.syncSettings.setOwner=false
```

Or for an existing vCluster, update the configuration:

```bash title="Update existing vCluster configuration"
vcluster create --upgrade my-vcluster --set experimental.syncSettings.setOwner=false
```

## Use KAI scheduler for vCluster workloads {#use-kai-scheduler-for-workloads}

After applying this configuration, you can use the KAI scheduler for your vCluster workloads by specifying `schedulerName: kai-scheduler` in the pod specification.

### Example: CPU-only workload {#example-cpu-only-workload}
<!-- vale on -->

Here's an example of a CPU-only pod using the KAI scheduler:

```yaml title="CPU-only pod with KAI scheduler"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: cpu-only-pod
spec:
  # highlight-start
  schedulerName: kai-scheduler
  # highlight-end
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: ubuntu
    args:
    - sleep
    - infinity
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 250M
```


<!-- vale off -->
### Example: GPU workload {#example-gpu-workload}
<!-- vale on -->

Here's an example of a GPU pod using the KAI scheduler:

```yaml title="GPU pod with KAI scheduler"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod
spec:
  # highlight-start
  schedulerName: kai-scheduler
  # highlight-end
  containers:
  - name: main
    image: ubuntu
    command:
    - /bin/bash
    - -c
    - nvidia-smi && sleep infinity
    resources:
      requests:
        nvidia.com/gpu: '1'
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: '1'
```

## Verify configuration {#verify-configuration}

To verify that the KAI scheduler is properly configured with vCluster:

- Confirm vCluster is using `experimental.syncSettings.setOwner=false` in its configuration

- Check that pods are being annotated with the podgroup name:
  ```bash title="Verify pod has podgroup annotation"
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> | grep pod-group-name
  ```

- Ensure the KAI scheduler components are running:
  ```bash title="Check KAI scheduler components"
  kubectl get pods -n kai-scheduler
  ```

:::info Scheduler behavior
When using the KAI scheduler with vCluster and `setOwner: false`, you may observe:

1. The pod-grouper adds a podgroup annotation to your pod:
```
Annotations: pod-group-name: pg-pod-name-[uuid]
```

2. You might see a non-blocking message in the logs:
```
Detected pod with no owner but with podgroup annotation
```
This is expected and doesn't affect scheduling.

The `setOwner: false` configuration successfully resolves owner reference issues and allows the KAI scheduler to work properly with vCluster workloads in production environments.
:::

## How it works {#how-it-works}

The KAI scheduler's pod-grouper component is a controller that:
- Watches pods with `schedulerName: kai-scheduler`
- Traverses the owner references to find the topmost owner
- Groups related pods for optimal scheduling decisions
- Applies custom scheduling logic based on workload type

When vCluster syncs pods to the host cluster, it sets an owner reference to the vCluster service by default. By disabling this with `setOwner: false`, the pod-grouper can process the pods normally without needing to follow service references.

## Limitations and considerations {#limitations-and-considerations}

- The `experimental.syncSettings.setOwner: false` configuration is marked as experimental and may change in future vCluster releases
- If you have other features that rely on pod ownership in vCluster, disabling owner references may affect those features
- The KAI scheduler might require additional configuration for advanced features like GPU sharing and queue management
- For GPU workloads, ensure that the host cluster has the necessary GPU drivers and device plugins installed
