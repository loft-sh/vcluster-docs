# What is vCluster pod creation?

In a vCluster, pod creation is not a direct process like in a standard Kubernetes cluster. Instead, it involves a unique mechanism that bridges your virtual cluster with the underlying host cluster.

Imagine a vCluster as a virtual layer on top of a physical Kubernetes cluster. When you create a pod, it doesn't magically appear in the host cluster. Instead, it goes through a process that ensures your virtual cluster remains isolated while still using the resources of the host cluster.

A pod in a vCluster isn't created directly in the host cluster but follows a well-defined process. This document explains the behind-the-scenes mechanism of pod creation in vCluster.

## Key components

The crucial components involved in vCluster pod creation are:
- **Kube-apiserver (host cluster)**: Manages resources in the underlying physical cluster.
- **Kube-apiserver (vCluster)**: Handles API requests within the virtual cluster.
- **Syncer**: Bridges communication between vCluster and host cluster.

<Step>
**Pod Creation in vCluster**

Create a pod by making an API call to the vCluster kube-apiserver. The API server stores the pod in the vCluster backend storage (etcd).

Example:
```bash
kubectl create -f my-pod.yaml -n my-vcluster
```
</Step>

<Step>
**Syncer synchronization**.

The syncer monitors events from the vCluster `kube-apiserver`. It communicates with the host cluster `kube-apiserver` to synchronize the pod creation.

Key actions:
- Watch vCluster events.
- Translate vCluster pod configuration.
- Initiate pod creation in host cluster.
</Step>

<Step>
**Host cluster pod deployment**.

The host cluster processes the pod creation request:
- Brings the pod up using standard Kubernetes procedures.
- Sets the pod state to `ready`.
- Treats the pod like any other cluster pod.

Verification:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n host-cluster-namespace
```
</Step>

<Step>
**Status synchronization**.

After the pod reaches `state=ready`, the syncer:
- Copies the pod's status from the host cluster.
- Applies the status to the corresponding pod in the vCluster namespace.

Status check:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n my-vcluster
```
</Step>
