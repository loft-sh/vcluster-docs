### Prerequisites

- `kubectl` installed
- `external-secrets` operator installed on your host cluster. See instructions at https://external-secrets.io/latest/

# External secrets integration

To enable the external secret integration, set the following fields:

```yaml
integrations:
  externalSecrets:
    enabled: true
    sync:
      externalSecrets:
        enabled: true
      stores:
        enabled: true
      clusterStores:
        enabled: true
```

This enables the integration, imports cluster stores from the host cluster into the virtual cluster, and exports namespaced stores from the virtual cluster into the host cluster.

Once the virtual cluster is up and running, you can create a secret store inside the virtual cluster. For this guide, you use the `fake` store type, which prefills data instead of connecting to a distant secret store.

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: SecretStore
metadata:
  name: fake
spec:
  provider:
    fake:
      data:
      - key: "/foo/bar"
        value: "HELLO1"
        version: "v1"
      - key: "/foo/bar"
        value: "HELLO2"
        version: "v2"
      - key: "/foo/baz"
        value: '{"john": "doe"}'
        version: "v1"
```

Inside the virtual cluster, create the store with `kubectl apply -f fake.yaml`. This should create a corresponding store in the host cluster. You can then create an `ExternalSecret` in the virtual cluster, which references the `SecretStore`.

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    name: fake
    kind: SecretStore
  target:
    name: secret-to-be-created
  data:
  - secretKey: foo_bar
    remoteRef:
      key: /foo/bar
      version: v1
  dataFrom:
  - extract:
      key: /foo/baz
      version: v1
```

After the external secret is created in the virtual cluster, the integration creates a corresponding external secret inside the host cluster.
The external secret operator running in the host creates the corresponding Kubernetes secret, and the integration imports this
Kubernetes secret into the virtual cluster. Running `kubectl get secrets` in the virtual cluster includes the `secret-to-be-created` in its output.
