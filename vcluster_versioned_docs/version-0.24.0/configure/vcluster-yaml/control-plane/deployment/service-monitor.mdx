import ServiceMonitor from '../../../../_partials/config/controlPlane/serviceMonitor.mdx'

Enable `serviceMonitor` when you are using the [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/prologue/introduction/) to monitor your vCluster instance. Prometheus handles scraping & aggregating metrics (in the case of high availability), and provides a query engine. Visualization tools such as [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) can then use Prometheus as a data source to graph / monitor / alert the vCluster control plane.

When enabled, vCluster exposes metrics over HTTPS at a `/metrics` endpoint.
