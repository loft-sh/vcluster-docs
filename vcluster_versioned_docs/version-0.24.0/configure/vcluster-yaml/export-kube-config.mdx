Customize how vCluster exports the kubeconfig file to a secret for use in tools like ArgoCD, Flux, or Terraform pipelines.

By default, vCluster stores the kubeconfig in a secret named `vc-NAME` within the namespace where vCluster is deployed. 
You can [customize this default secret](#customize-the-default-secret).

In addition to the default secret, you can also [export additional kubeconfig secrets](#export-additional-secrets).

{/*
`--kube-config-context-name` is now the `context` property:
  - https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/554 is the issue where this was requested
  - Configures the context name in the kubeconfig that is written to a secret.
`--out-kube-config-server` is now the `server` property:
  - https://www.vcluster.com/docs/using-vclusters/kube-context#externally-accessible-vclusters
`--out-kube-config-secret-namespace` is now the `secret.namespace` property.
  - It appears in the "Tip" at the bottom of this section: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/using-vclusters/kube-context#retrieving-the-kube-config-from-the-vcluster-secret
`--out-kube-config-secret` is now the `secret.name` property:
  - It did not have a section in the old docs, but has been part of vcluster from the initial commit, and has always been set to `vc-{{ .Release.Name }}` by the Helm chart.
  - We may not want people changing this.

## Customize the default secret

The following example configures a virtual cluster to use a specific kubeconfig context and server endpoint for the default
kubeconfig secret `vc-NAME`:

- Set the kubeconfig context name to `my-domain-context`.
- Configure the kubeconfig to use `https://my-domain.org:443` as the endpoint for the exposed virtual cluster.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-domain-context
  server: https://my-domain.org:443
```

Customizing the default secret does not affect the additional kubeconfig secrets that are configured separately with the
`exportKubeConfig.additionalSecrets` field. E.g. in the above example, custom context and server values are used only
for the default secret `vc-NAME` and do not affect the additional secrets that you may have configured.

:::note

The default secret and the secret specified with the deprecated `exportKubeConfig.secret` field are customized with
the same set of fields (`exportKubeConfig.context`, `exportKubeConfig.server`, etc), so setting these fields customizes
both the default and the deprecated secret in the same way. More details in the [migration section below](#migrate-customized-deprecated-secret-to-new-additional-secrets).

## Export additional secrets

You can export additional kubeconfig secrets by specifying `exportKubeConfig.additionalSecrets`.

### Using the default namespace for the additional secret

The following example configures a virtual cluster to export an additional secret `vc-my-domain`, which is created in
the namespace where vCluster is deployed.

In this example, the additional secret `vc-my-domain` is customized in the following way:
- Set the kubeconfig context name to `my-domain-context`.
- Configure the kubeconfig to use `https://my-domain.org:443` as the server endpoint for the exposed virtual cluster.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  additionalSecrets:
  - name: vc-my-domain
    context: my-domain-context
    server: https://my-domain.org:443
```

You can create multiple additional secrets. Each additional secret is configured separately, and configuring additional
secrets does not affect the default kubeconfig secret. E.g. in the above example, custom context and server values are
used only for the additional secret `vc-my-domain` and do not affect the default kubeconfig secret, nor any other
additional secret that you may have configured.

### Using a new namespace for the additional secret

The following example configures a virtual cluster to store the kubeconfig secret in a separate namespace while maintaining
proper access control:

- Set the kubeconfig context name to `my-domain-context`.
- Configure the kubeconfig to use `https://my-domain.org:443` as the virtual cluster endpoint.
- Create a namespace called `kubeconfig-secret-namespace` to store the secret.
- Name the secret `vc-my-domain` instead of using the default "vc-NAME" (where `NAME` is the vCluster name).
- Additionally, grant access to the new namespace by creating a `Role` and `RoleBinding` for the vCluster service account:
  - Configure the new role with the same permissions assigned to the vCluster app role in the original namespace.
  - If needed, copy permissions from the default vCluster deployment.
  - When vCluster permissions change, update the unmanaged role in the target namespace accordingly.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  additionalSecrets:
  - namespace: kubeconfig-secret-namespace
    name: vc-my-domain
    context: my-domain-context
    server: https://my-domain.org:443
```

### Deprecated `exportKubeConfig.secret` config

Starting from version 0.24.0, the `exportKubeConfig.secret` configuration is deprecated and replaced by `exportKubeConfig.additionalSecrets`.

#### Migrate a deprecated secret to new additional secrets

It is recommended to migrate the deprecated `exportKubeConfig.secret` config to the new `exportKubeConfig.additionalSecrets`.

If `my-secret` is configured such as:

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  secret:
    name: my-secret
```

You can migrate the secret to the new additional secret with the following:

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  additionalSecrets:
  - name: my-secret
```

#### Migrate a customized deprecated secret to new additional secrets

The secret defined using the deprecated `exportKubeConfig.secret` field is customized using the same configuration fields (such as `exportKubeConfig.context`, `exportKubeConfig.server`) as the default kubeconfig secret.

For example, in the following configuration, vCluster exports a kubeconfig secret named `vc-my-domain` with:

- Context: `my-domain-context`
- Server endpoint: `https://my-domain.org:443`

vCluster also exports the default kubeconfig secret using these same context and server values.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-domain-context
  server: https://my-domain.org:443
  secret:
    name: vc-my-domain
```

When migrating this customized deprecated secret to the new additional secrets, you have the following two options.

1\. Customize both the default and the additional kubeconfig secret.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-domain-context
  server: https://my-domain.org:443
  additionalSecrets:
  - name: vc-my-domain
    context: my-domain-context
    server: https://my-domain.org:443
```

In this example, both the default secret `vc-NAME` and the additional secret `vc-my-domain` use the same custom values
for the context and the server, which gives you the same exported kubeconfig secrets as with the old config that used
the deprecated `exportKubeConfig.secret`.

You might want to export the additional secret with different config values for the context and the server. You can achieve
this by customizing the additional secret differently than the default secret:

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-domain-context
  server: https://my-domain.org:443
  additionalSecrets:
  - name: vc-my-domain
    context: my-other-domain-context
    server: https://my-other-domain.org:443
```

2\. Customize only the additional kubeconfig secret.

```yaml
exportKubeConfig:
  additionalSecrets:
  - name: vc-my-domain
    context: my-domain-context
    server: https://my-domain.org:443
```

In this example, only the additional secret `vc-my-domain` uses custom values for the context and the server.
