# Sleep mode

Not all workloads need to run all the time, and scaling them down saves time and money. With sleep mode you can scale down workloads based on a set schedule, or activity from users and ingress.

:::warning
Sleep mode is intended for pre-production use cases only, and comes with some limitations and
caveats when used on a stand alone vCluster that is not connected to [the Platform](../../../../platform/use-platform/virtual-clusters/key-features/sleep-mode).
:::

## How it works

### Sleep mode operations

Sleep mode performs two main operations:

**Sleeping**
Deletes bare pods and scales down the following resources:
- Deployments
- ReplicaSets
- ReplicationControllers
- DaemonSets

**Waking**

- Scales resources back to their original state
- Cannot restore previously deleted bare pods

### Resource exemption

Resources can be exempted from sleep mode using either:
- Adding the annotation `sleepmode.loft.sh/exclude: true`
- Configuring `sleepMode` with specific labels
- Adding configured labels to workloads that should keep running

## Detecting activity

To wake a sleeping cluster or to update the last active time, sleep mode captures the following:

- Access of cluster resources through API calls (e.g., `kubectl get <resource>`)
- Attempts to contact Ingress endpoints (NGINX only)

:::note
Ingress activity detection is only available for [NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main)
ingress controllers, making use of the [mirror-target](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#mirror)
annotation.  This has the effect of overwriting any previously set mirror-target annotation.
:::

### Ignoring other types of activity

| Annotation| Behavior | Format |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-all" | ignore all activity | "true" OR "false" |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-ingresses" | ignore requests to associated ingresses  | "true" OR "false"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-groups" | ignore requests with a specific apigroup | "apps,group2,group3" |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-resources" | ignore requests to specific resource types  | "pods,resource2,resource3"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-verbs" | ignore requests with specific verbs | "create,verb1,verb2"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-resource-verbs" | ignore requests with specific verbs to specific resources |  "myresource.mygroup=create update delete, myresource2.mygroup=create update" |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-resource-names" | ignore requests to specific resources with specific names | "myresource.mygroup=name1 name2,myotherresource.mygroup=name1"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-user-agents" | ignore specific useragents with trailling wildcard support | "kubectl*,argo,useragent3"  |

:::note
These annotations are to be added to the vCluster workload, e.g. the `StatefulSet` or `Deployment` running the virtual cluster, and any request can be ignored dynamically by adding the header `X-Sleep-Mode-Ignore`.

## Differences and compatibility with the platform

The documentation on this page describes sleep mode for a vCluster not connected to the platform.  The main difference in effect between the two is that
an agent on the host cluster can shut down the vCluster workload, i.e. the control plane, entirely, whereas the vCluster on its own must remain active
to monitor for any activity that should wake it up.  This also means auto deletion is not available without an agent.  The aim of this and
future versions is to have a single configuration and a seamless transition between the two if you start with vCluster only and connect it to the platform
at a later date.

### Connecting to the platform

When a vCluster configured for sleep mode is connected to the platform, it ceases trying to manage its own sleep mode actions, allowing the agent to take over,
but this requires compatible versions between vCluster and platform. Below is a table of compatibility and migration.


| vCluster Version | Platform Version | Compatibility |  Installing an agent | Uninstalling an agent |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 0.22.x | 4.2.x | ✅ | Manually update they're configuration, moving it from `experimental` to `external.platform`, translating any durations like `90m` into equivalent seconds `5400`.  Schema validation prevents configuring both at the same time to guide users. | Configuration needs to be manual reverted. |
| 0.23.x | 4.2.x | ✅ | Manually update they're configuration, moving it from `experimental` to `external.platform`, translating any durations like `90m` into equivalent seconds `5400`.  Schema validation prevents configuring both at the same time to guide users. | Configuration needs to be manual reverted. |
| 0.24.0 | &lt; 4.3.0 | ❌ | These versions are not compatible, as the vCluster version is ahead of the platform, causing the vcluster creation to be rejected.   | N/A |
| 0.24.0 | 4.3.0 | ✅ | No action required by the user.  Platform reads the unified configuration and take over as though it had been configured for the platform all along. | The annotation `vcluster.loft.sh/agent-installed` needs to be removed from the vCluster configuration secret in the host cluster to inform the vCluster it needs to take over sleep mode again.  That secret's name has the form `vc-config-<vcluster-name>`. |
| 0.24.0+ (future release) | 4.3.0 | ✅ | No action required.  Platform reads the unified configuration and take over as though it had been configured for the platform all along. | No action required, and the vCluster resumes sleep mode on only the workloads, not the control plane. |

:::info
 - In 0.23.0, the platform won't know how to wake a vCluster that put itself to sleep, so the vCluster should be resumed, before installing the agent to take over.
 - In 0.24.0, the `autoDelete` configuration is still under `external.platform` to be moved under sleepMode in a future release.

## Enable sleep mode

To enable sleep mode, use the following configuration inside your `vcluster.yaml`:

```yaml title="sleep mode configuration"
sleepMode:
  enabled: true
  autoSleep:
    afterInactivity: 1h
```

## Ingress configuration

### Sync to host

If you install your ingress controllers in the vCluster you'll need to exempt the controller from sleeping so it remains
active for requests that would wake the vCluster.  If you install the `Ingress` controller in the host cluster, you'll need to
enable syncing ingresses to the host.

```yaml title="enable ingress syncing"
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```

### Reachability

For proper ingress activity detection:
- The vCluster pod must be discoverable by the ingress controller
- DNS lookup for `<vcluster-namespace>.<vcluster-svc-name>.svc.cluster.local` must resolve
- Proper `dnsPolicy` configuration in the ingress controller Helm installation

## Examples

The below examples demonstrate how to configure sleep mode in a virtual cluster.
Please make sure to install the necessary prerequisites before proceeding.
