# Sleep mode

Not all workloads need to run all the time, and scaling them down saves time and money. With sleep mode you can scale down workloads based on a set schedule, or activity from users and ingress.

:::warning
Sleep mode is intended for pre-production use cases only, and comes with some limitations and
caveats when used on a stand alone vCluster that is not connected to [the Platform](/platform/use-platform/virtual-clusters/key-features/sleep-mode).
:::

## Enable sleep mode

To enable sleep mode, use the following configuration inside your `vcluster.yaml`:

```yaml title="sleep mode configuration"
sleepMode:
  enabled: true
  autoSleep:
    afterInactivity: 1h
```

## How it works

### Sleep mode operations

Sleep mode performs two main operations:

**Sleeping**
Deletes bare pods and scales down the following resources:
- Deployments
- ReplicaSets
- ReplicationControllers
- DaemonSets

**Waking**

- Scales resources back to their original state
- Cannot restore previously deleted bare pods

### Resource exemption

Resources can be exempted from sleep mode using by:
- Adding the annotation `sleepmode.loft.sh/exclude: true`
- Configuring `sleepMode` with [specific labels](/docs/vcluster/next/configure/vcluster-yaml/sleep-mode?x3=1#sleepMode-autoSleep-exclude-selector-labels)
- Adding configured labels to workloads that should keep running

## Detecting activity

To wake a sleeping cluster or to update the last active time, sleep mode captures the following:

- Access of cluster resources through API calls (e.g., `kubectl get <resource>`)
- Attempts to contact Ingress endpoints (NGINX only)

:::note
Ingress activity detection is only available for [NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main)
ingress controllers, making use of the [mirror-target](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#mirror)
annotation.  This has the effect of overwriting any previously set mirror-target annotation.
:::

### Ignoring other types of activity

While [resource exemption](#resource-exemption) allows specifically configured resources to remain active when the vCluster goes to sleep, the following describes how to
ignore requests that would otherwise denote the cluster should stay awake, or wake up if it is sleeping.

| Annotation| Behavior | Format |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-all" | ignore all activity | "true" OR "false" |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-ingresses" | ignore requests to associated ingresses  | "true" OR "false"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-groups" | ignore specified groups the requesting user belongs to | "group2,group3" |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-resources" | ignore requests to specific resource types  | "pods,resource2,resource3"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-verbs" | ignore requests with specific verbs | "create,verb1,verb2"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-resource-verbs" | ignore requests with specific verbs to specific resources |  "myresource.mygroup=create update delete, myresource2.mygroup=create update" |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-resource-names" | ignore requests to specific resources with specific names | "myresource.mygroup=name1 name2,myotherresource.mygroup=name1"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/ignore-user-agents" | ignore specific useragents with trailling wildcard support | "kubectl*,argo,useragent3"  |
| "sleepmode.loft.sh/disable-ingress-wakeup" | ignore ingress access | "true"  |

:::note
These annotations are to be added to the vCluster workload, e.g. the `StatefulSet` or `Deployment` running the virtual cluster, and any request can be ignored dynamically by adding the header `X-Sleep-Mode-Ignore`.
:::

## Differences and compatibility with the platform

The documentation on this page describes two primary methods for sleep mode. The first is without an agent, where workloads are scaled down, but the control plane remains active to monitor for activity that should wake it up.
When a vCluster is connected to the platform via an agent, the agent can fully shut down the control plane, reducing resource usage further. Additionally, auto-deletion is only available when an agent is present.

### Connecting to the platform

When a vCluster, configured for sleep mode, is connected to the platform, it ceases trying to manage its own sleep mode actions, allowing the agent to take over.
This requires compatible versions between vCluster and platform.  Below is a table of compatibility and additional steps needed to be performed when installing or uninstalling an agent.
<br/>

| vCluster Version | Platform Version | Compatibility |  Installing an agent | Uninstalling an agent |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 0.22.x | 4.2.x | ✅ | Manually update vCluster config, moving it from `experimental` to `external.platform`. Translate any durations like `90m` into equivalent seconds e.g. `5400`.  Schema validation prevents configuring both at the same time. | Configuration needs to be manual reverted. |
| 0.23.x | 4.2.x | ✅ | Manually update vCluster config, moving it from `experimental` to `external.platform`. Translate any durations like `90m` into equivalent seconds e.g. `5400`.  Schema validation prevents configuring both at the same time. | Configuration needs to be manual reverted. |
| 0.24.0 | &lt;4.3.0 | ❌ | These versions are not compatible, as the vCluster version is ahead of the platform, causing the vcluster creation to be rejected.   | N/A |
| 0.24.0 | &ge;4.3.0 | ✅ | No action required.  Platform reads the unified vCluster config and take over as though it had been configured for the platform all along. | The annotation `vcluster.loft.sh/agent-installed` needs to be removed from the vCluster config secret in the host cluster to inform the vCluster it needs to take over sleep mode again.  That secret's name has the form `vc-config-<vcluster-name>`. |
| &ge;0.24.0 (future release) | &ge;4.3.0 | ✅ | No action required.  Platform reads the unified config and take over as though it had been configured for the platform all along. | No action required, and the vCluster resumes sleep mode on only the workloads, not the control plane. |

:::note
 - In 0.23.x, the platform won't know how to wake a vCluster that put itself to sleep, so the vCluster should be resumed, before installing the agent to take over.
 - In 0.24.x, the `autoDelete` configuration is still under `external.platform` to be moved under sleepMode in a future release.

## Ingress configuration

### Sync to host

If you install your ingress controllers in the vCluster you'll need to exempt the controller from sleeping so it remains
active for requests that would wake the vCluster.  If you install the `Ingress` controller in the host cluster, you'll need to
enable syncing ingresses to the host.

```yaml title="enable ingress syncing"
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```

### Reachability

For proper ingress activity detection:
- The vCluster pod must be discoverable by the ingress controller
- DNS lookup for `<vcluster-namespace>.<vcluster-svc-name>.svc.cluster.local` must resolve
- Proper `dnsPolicy` configuration in the ingress controller Helm installation

## Examples

The below examples demonstrate how to configure sleep mode in a virtual cluster.
