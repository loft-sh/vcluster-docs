# Sleep mode

Not all workloads need to run continuously. Scaling them down reduces costs. With sleep mode, you can scale workloads based on a set schedule or user activity and ingress.

:::warning
Sleep mode is intended for pre-production use cases only, and has limitations when used on a virtual cluster instance not connected to the platform.
:::

## Enable sleep mode

To enable sleep mode, add the following configuration to your `vcluster.yaml`:

```yaml title="Sleep mode configuration"
sleepMode:
  enabled: true
  autoSleep:
    afterInactivity: 1h
```

:::info Time duration format
The `afterInactivity` field uses Go duration format with a maximum unit of hours. Valid time units are:
- `s` for seconds (e.g., `30s`)
- `m` for minutes (e.g., `10m`)
- `h` for hours (e.g., `1h`, `24h` for one day)

Days (`d`) are not supported. Use hours instead (e.g., `72h` for 3 days).
:::

## Sleep mode operations

Sleep mode involves two main actions: **sleeping** and **waking**. These actions help save resources when the cluster is not in use.

**Sleeping** reduces resource consumption and costs during inactive periods.

- Delete bare pods: Pods not managed by controllers are removed permanently.
- Scale down resources: The following resources are scaled down to reduce resource usage:
  - Deployments
  - ReplicaSets
  - ReplicationControllers
  - DaemonSets

**Waking** restore scaled-down resources.

- Restore scaled-down resources: Deployments, ReplicaSets, ReplicationControllers, and DaemonSets are returned to their original state.
- Bare pods are not restored: Bare pods deleted during the Sleeping step cannot be recovered.

### Without an agent
**How it works**: The virtual cluster instance manages sleep mode itself by scaling down workloads (pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.) while keeping the control plane active.

**What happens**:
- Workloads are scaled down to zero replicas
- Control plane remains running (API server, etcd, syncer)
- Cluster can detect activity and wake up automatically
- Resource savings are moderate (workloads only)

**Use when**: You want automatic sleep/wake feature but don't have the platform or prefer instance-managed sleep mode.

### With a platform agent
**How it works**: When connected to the platform using an agent, the platform agent takes over sleep mode management and can shut down the entire control plane.

**What happens**:
- Workloads are scaled down to zero replicas
- Control plane can be completely shut down (maximum resource savings)
- Platform manages sleep/wake operations
- Enables additional features like auto-deletion

**Use when**: You want maximum resource savings and advanced features like auto-deletion, or you're already using the platform for virtual cluster instance management.

### Key differences

| Feature | Without agent | With agent |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Control plane | Remains active | Can be shut down completely |
| Resource savings | Moderate (workloads only) | Maximum (workloads + control plane) |
| Auto-deletion | Not available | Available |
| Management | virtual cluster instance manages itself | Platform agent manages |
| Activity detection | Supported | Supported |
| Scheduling | Supported | Supported |


### Resource exemption in sleep mode {#resource-exemption}

In sleep mode, you can prevent specific resources from entering sleep mode by configuring them with the following options:

- Add the annotation `sleepmode.loft.sh/exclude: true` to the resource.
- Configure `sleepMode` with [specific labels](/docs/vcluster/next/configure/vcluster-yaml/sleep#enable-sleep-with-label-selectors-and-schedules) to define which resources should remain active. This allows targeting specific resources based on their labels.
- Add labels to workloads that you want to remain active. By using labels, it is possible to control which resources are exempt from sleep mode at a more granular level.

### Detect activity in sleep mode

Sleep mode tracks certain actions to detect activity and wake the cluster when necessary. To wake a sleeping cluster or update the last active time, sleep mode captures the following actions:

- Accessing cluster resources through API calls (for example `kubectl get <resource>`).
- Attempting to contact ingress endpoints (NGINX and Istio only).

:::note
Ingress activity detection with the [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main) (deprecated) ingress controller relies on the [mirror-target](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#mirror) annotation, which will overwrite any previously set mirror-target annotation.
:::

### Ignore other types of activity in sleep mode

The [resource exemption](#resource-exemption) feature keeps specifically configured resources active when the virtual cluster instance enters sleep mode. The [Configure request handling for sleep mode table](#configure-request) describes how to ignore requests that keep the cluster awake or wake it up if it is asleep.

:::note
Add the annotations to the virtual cluster instance workload, such as the StatefulSet or Deployment running the virtual cluster. You can dynamically ignore any request by adding the `X-Sleep-Mode-Ignore` header.
:::

### Connect to the platform

When you connect a virtual cluster instance that has sleep mode configured to the platform (via an agent), the platform agent automatically takes over sleep mode management. The virtual cluster instance stops managing its own sleep mode and the agent handles all sleep/wake operations.

### Transition from instance-managed to agent-managed sleep mode

When a virtual cluster instance with sleep mode configured connects to the platform:
- The platform reads the existing `sleepMode` configuration
- The agent takes over sleep mode management automatically
- No configuration changes are needed (for vCluster 0.24.0+ and platform 4.3.0+)
- The virtual cluster instance's sleep mode configuration continues to work, but is now managed by the platform agent

This requires compatible versions of virtual cluster instance and the platform. The [vCluster and platform version compatibility with agent installation table](#vcluster-platform-compatibility) provides the steps needed for installing or uninstalling an agent.

<br/>

<details id="vcluster-platform-compatibility">
<summary>vCluster and platform version compatibility with agent installation table</summary>

| vCluster version | Platform version | Compatibility |  Installing an agent | Uninstalling an agent |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 0.22.x | 4.2.x | ✅ | Update the virtual cluster instance config manually, moving it from `experimental` to `external.platform`. Convert durations, such as "90m", into seconds, for example, "5400". Schema validation prevents both configurations from being applied at the same time. | Manually revert the configuration. |
| 0.23.x | 4.2.x | ✅ | Update the virtual cluster instance config manually, moving it from `experimental` to `external.platform`. Convert durations, such as "90m", into seconds, for example, "5400". Schema validation prevents both configurations from being applied at the same time. | Manually revert the configuration. |
| 0.24.0 | &lt;4.3.0 | ❌ | These versions are not compatible, as the vCluster version is ahead of the platform, which causes the virtual cluster instance creation to be rejected. | Not applicable.|
| 0.24.0 | &ge;4.3.0 | ✅ | No action is required. The platform reads the unified virtual cluster instance config and takes over as if it had been configured for the platform all along. | Remove the annotation `vcluster.loft.sh/agent-installed` from the virtual cluster instance config secret in the host cluster to notify the virtual cluster instance that it needs to resume sleep mode. The secret’s name is `vc-config-[vcluster-name]`.|
| &ge;0.24.0 | &ge;4.3.0 | ✅ | No action is required. The platform reads the unified config and takes over as if it had been configured for the platform all along. | No action is required, and the virtual cluster instance resumes sleep mode for workloads only, not the control plane. |
</details>

:::note vCluster sleep mode considerations
- In version 0.23.x, the platform does not know how to wake a virtual cluster instance that has put itself to sleep. Ensure the virtual cluster instance is resumed before installing the agent to take over.
- In version 0.24.x, the `autoDelete` configuration is still under `external.platform` and is set to move under `sleepMode` in a later release. `external.platform` to be moved under sleepMode in a future release.
:::

## Ingress configuration

### Sync to host

If you install ingress controllers in the virtual cluster instance, prevent them from sleeping. This keeps the controllers active and allows them to handle requests that would wake the virtual cluster instance. If you install the ingress controller in the host cluster, enable ingress syncing to the host.

```yaml title="Enable ingress syncing"
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```

### Reachability for ingress activity detection

To enable ingress activity detection in your virtual cluster instance, ensure the following conditions are met:

- The ingress controller needs to be able to discover the virtual cluster instance pod to route traffic correctly.
- Ensure that the DNS lookup for `<vcluster-namespace>.<vcluster-svc-name>.svc.cluster.local` resolves properly. This allows the ingress controller to reach the virtual cluster instance's service address.
- Ensure that the correct `dnsPolicy` is set in the ingress controller's Helm chart. This ensures DNS resolution works as expected and allows communication between the ingress controller and the virtual cluster instance.


## Configure sleep mode in a virtual cluster

The following examples demonstrate how to configure sleep mode in a virtual cluster.

Ensure you install the necessary prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

<BasePrerequisites />

- `vCluster`: vCluster command-line tool to provision and manage virtual clusters.
  <InstallCli />
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/): Platform for building and running containerized applications
- [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/): Tool for running local Kubernetes clusters in Docker
- [`curl`](https://curl.se/download.html): Command-line tool for transferring data over the network

### Deployment

A deployment resource in Kubernetes manages a set of identical pods. Configuring sleep mode for a deployment scales down the pods while keeping the control plane active.
This setup allows the virtual cluster to reduce resource usage while still being able to monitor activity and trigger wake-up actions when needed.

:::note Control plane behavior
- **Without agent**: The control plane remains active, allowing the virtual cluster instance to monitor activity and wake up automatically.
- **With agent**: The platform agent can shut down the control plane completely for maximum resource savings.
:::

This setup allows the virtual cluster to reduce resource usage while still being able to monitor activity and trigger wake-up actions when needed.

### Ingress controller

An ingress controller, such as NGINX, manages external HTTP/S traffic to services in a Kubernetes cluster.
To configure sleep mode for the ingress controller, make sure it stays responsive to incoming traffic and can wake up the cluster if needed. This setup keeps the ingress controller active, even when the virtual cluster instance is in sleep mode and allows the controller to handle requests that trigger the virtual cluster to wake up.

<SleepModeIngressExample />
</details>

### Istio gateway

:::note
Enable Istio integration for sleep mode to work with Istio resources.
:::

When Istio is installed on the host cluster and the [Istio integration](./integrations/istio) is enabled, the virtual cluster instance syncs [Gateway](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/) and [VirtualService](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) resources to the host cluster.

With sleep mode enabled, any traffic routed to a Service in the virtual cluster instance is tracked as activity and keeps the virtual cluster instance awake. If the vCluster is asleep, incoming traffic wakes it up.

  <SleepModeIstioExample />
</details>

### Enable sleep mode with label selectors and schedules

Use label selectors and schedules to configure sleep mode based on inactivity or specific timing:

<details>
<summary>Sleep mode label selectors and schedule</summary>

```yaml title="Sleep after 3 hours of inactivity, anything that does not have the label dont=sleep"
sleepMode:
  enabled: true
  autoSleep:
    afterInactivity: 3h  # Uses Go duration with a max unit of hour
    exclude:
      selector:
        labels:
          dont: sleep
```

```yaml title="Sleep every Friday at 17:30 and wake every Monday at 7:00 in Mountain timezone"
sleepMode:
  enabled: true
  timeZone: America/Denver
  autoSleep:
    schedule: 30 17 * * 5
  autoWakeup:
    schedule: 0 7 * * 1
```
