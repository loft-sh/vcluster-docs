Workloads created by vCluster are able to communicate with other workloads in the host cluster through their cluster IPs. Configure network policies when you want to isolate namespaces and do not want the pods running inside the virtual cluster to have access to other workloads in the host cluster.

## Enable network isolation {#enable-isolation}

Set `policies.networkPolicy.enabled` to create NetworkPolicies that isolate the virtual cluster:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
```

This creates NetworkPolicies in the host namespace that:
- Allow traffic between pods within the virtual cluster
- Block traffic from other namespaces
- Permit DNS and API server communication

### Example configurations {#examples}

#### Basic isolation {#basic-isolation}

The simplest configuration enables network isolation with default settings:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
```

#### Custom egress rules {#custom-egress}

Control outbound traffic with specific CIDR blocks:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
    outgoingConnections:
      ipBlock:
        cidr: 0.0.0.0/0
        except:
          - 169.254.0.0/16  # AWS metadata service
          - 10.0.0.0/8      # Private network ranges
          - 172.16.0.0/12
          - 192.168.0.0/16
```

#### Add custom labels {#custom-labels}

Apply labels to generated NetworkPolicies for easier management:

```yaml title="vcluster.yaml"
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
    labels:
      environment: production
      team: platform
    annotations:
      description: "Network isolation for production vCluster"
```

:::warning DNS Port in vCluster
vCluster uses port 1053 for DNS queries, not the standard port 53. When creating custom NetworkPolicies for pods inside vCluster, ensure DNS rules target port 1053:

```yaml
ports:
  - port: 1053
    protocol: UDP
```
:::

## Project-scoped isolation with Platform {#project-scoped-isolation}

For Platform users needing project-level network boundaries, combine `policies.networkPolicy` with [VirtualClusterTemplates](/platform/administer/templates/create-virtual-cluster-template):

```yaml title="project-isolated-template.yaml"
apiVersion: management.loft.sh/v1
kind: VirtualClusterTemplate
metadata:
  name: project-isolated
spec:
  template:
    helmRelease:
      chart:
        version: 0.26.0
      values: |
        policies:
          networkPolicy:
            enabled: true
            labels:
              vcluster.io/project: "{{ .Values.loft.project }}"
```

This automatically:
- Isolates virtual clusters by project
- Allows communication within the same project
- Enforces network boundaries for CI/CD pipelines
