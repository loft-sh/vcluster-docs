RuntimeClass syncing allows virtual clusters to use runtime classes from the host cluster. RuntimeClass resources define container runtime configurations including security sandboxes, alternative runtimes like gVisor or Kata Containers, and runtime-specific settings.

Virtual clusters are isolated from each other; a RuntimeClass created in one virtual cluster does not exist in another. For more details on enabling and disabling synced resources, see the [sync configuration documentation](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources).

You can enable this feature to sync RuntimeClass resources from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. Add labels to RuntimeClass resources in your host cluster and configure vCluster to sync only those matching specific selectors. When you create a Pod that references a synced RuntimeClass, the host cluster uses that runtime configuration.

This approach provides centralized control over runtime configurations and ensures consistent container runtime behavior across virtual clusters. Common use cases include:

- **Security isolation**: Control which security runtimes different teams can access while sharing a single host cluster. Only authorized workloads can use enhanced security runtimes such as gVisor or Kata Containers. This prevents unauthorized access to privileged runtime configurations.

- **Development environments**: Sync only required RuntimeClasses to reduce noise and avoid unnecessary exposure to production runtime configurations.

- **Multi-tenancy**: Enable teams to use specific runtime configurations while preventing access to incompatible or resource-intensive runtimes that could affect other tenants. Each team gets only the runtime classes appropriate for their workloads and security requirements.

- **Compliance**: Maintain strict control over container runtime configurations by defining runtime classes once in the host cluster and making only approved runtime configurations available to virtual clusters. All workloads use compliant runtime settings.

- **Resource optimization**: Prevent teams from using resource-intensive runtime configurations that could impact cluster performance without proper oversight. Access to high-overhead runtimes is restricted and used only when necessary.
