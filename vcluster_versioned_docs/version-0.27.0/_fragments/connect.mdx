```bash
vcluster connect vcluster-1

# OR: create a view only config
vcluster connect vcluster-1 --service-account viewer --cluster-role view
```

:::info
By default vCluster will try to detect the Kubernetes distribution and either use port-forwarding for remote clusters or it tries to configure the local Kubernetes environment to access the vCluster directly. For remote clusters you can also use `--expose` to create a LoadBalancer to access the vCluster directly or one of the external connection flows.
