import UpgradeVersion from '../../_partials/manage/upgrade-version.mdx'

At any time, you can upgrade the version of your vCluster. During the upgrade, you can also apply
configuration option changes.

Upgrades should be done one minor version at a time. While larger jumps may be possible, we do not actively test or support this path. 
The following list represents known upgrade path concerns, but does not include all breaking changes:
* In [v0.29](https://loft.featurebase.app/changelog/vcluster-v029-vcluster-standalone) etcd was upgraded to v3.6. The upstream etcd docs state that before upgrading to v3.6, you must already be on v3.5.20 or higher, otherwise failures may occur. This version of etcd was introduced in vCluster v0.24.2. Ensure that you have upgraded to at minimum that version, before upgrading to v0.29.
* In [v0.20](https://loft.featurebase.app/changelog/vcluster-v020-ga), `vcluster.yaml` was introduced which replaced `values.yaml`, and a migration was required. See the [following page](/docs/vcluster/reference/migrations/0-20-migration) for a guide on that path.

## Update `vcluster.yaml`

Optionally, you can update your `vcluster.yaml` to change your configuration options during a vCluster version upgrade.

<p></p>
:::warning Limitations on changing configuration
You cannot change distros or backing store once a virtual cluster is deployed, with one exception: starting with vCluster 0.25.0, migration from K3s to K8s distro is supported. For more details, see the [K3s to K8s Migration](./distro-migration.mdx).

## Upgrade vCluster version

These steps assume that you have been a `vcluster.yaml`, but there are variables in the code blocks for you to replace for:

- Name of the virtual cluster
- Namespace of where the virtual cluster is deployed
- Version to upgrade to

<UpgradeVersion />
