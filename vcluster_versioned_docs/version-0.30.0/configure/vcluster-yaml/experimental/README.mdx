## Experimental features

vCluster provides several experimental features that extend its capabilities:

### Available features

- **[Deploy](./deploy.mdx)** - Configure deployment settings for experimental features
- **[Sync settings](./sync-settings.mdx)** - Advanced synchronization configuration
- **[Deny proxy requests](./deny-proxy-requests.mdx)** - Block proxy requests to the host cluster

### Configure experimental features

Experimental features are configured under the `experimental` section of your vCluster configuration. These features might change between releases, so use them with caution in production environments.
