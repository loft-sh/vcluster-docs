Use `defaultImageRegistry` to configure a private image registry.

For example:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  advanced:
    defaultImageRegistry: my-private-registry:5000/vcluster/
```

vCluster prepends the image registry to all images used by vCluster, such as syncer, K3s, and CoreDNS. For example, `rancher/k3s:v1.29.1+k3s2` becomes `my-private-registry:5000/vcluster/rancher/k3s:v1.29.1+k3s2`.

You can find a list of all needed images by vCluster in the file `images.txt` at the releases page, as well as two scripts (`download-images.sh` and `push-images.sh`) to pull and push those to your private registry.

To use your private registry, you need to [configure `imagePullSecrets`](./service-account.

{/*
`advanced.defaultImageRegistry`:
- existing docs covers this well, however it may be needed to configure the vCluster service account with a pullSecret to use the private registry. See [this issue](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/333)
- multiple default image registries are not supported, and instead users need to override each image, see [this issue](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/issues/1200)
