Modify the vCluster control plane's ServiceAccount. You may need to do this in these situations:

- You are using a private image registry. See `defaultImageRegistry` [configuration](./default-image-registry.
- You are using a Cloud provider's IAM integration, such as [Google's Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) and AWS's [IAM roles for service accounts\(IRSA\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).
- You need to provide AuthN or AuthZ for cloud provider image registries.
