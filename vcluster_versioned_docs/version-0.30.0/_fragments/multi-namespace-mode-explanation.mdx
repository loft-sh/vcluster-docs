By default, all namespaced resources that need to be synced to the host cluster are created in the namespace where vCluster is installed. vCluster avoids naming conflicts where multiple resources could have the same name in different namespaces by rewriting the name of the resource in the host cluster.

For example, a pod within the vCluster called `test` in namespace `my-namespace` is rewritten for the host cluster to `test-x-my-namespace-x-my-vcluster` to avoid conflicts with other pods that would be named `test` in another namespace within the vCluster.

Because vCluster rewrites the resource name, all references from other objects to that resource will need to get rewritten as well. vCluster does this already for all core resources, e.g. mounting a secret in a pod within the vCluster is automatically rewritten to the correct secret name on the host cluster (without seeing that inside the vCluster).

However, when using features such as [syncing custom resources](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/advanced/custom-resources, it can be tedious to add all used references, or it can become very difficult or even impossible to rewrite certain references.

Hence, vCluster offers a second mode of operation, **Multi-Namespace-Mode** which is more tailored towards syncing custom resources. In multi-namespace mode, vCluster will create a namespace in the host cluster for each namespace in the virtual cluster. The namespace name is modified to avoid conflicts between multiple vCluster instances in the same host, but the synced namespaced resources are created with the same name as in the virtual cluster.

This is useful to easier sync custom CRDs since you don't need to rewrite most references as if you use a single namespace as sync target.

:::warning
Do not switch the vCluster mode in an already running vCluster, this will cause serious data loss!
