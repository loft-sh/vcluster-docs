vCluster can sync certain resources from the host cluster to make them available inside the virtual cluster, but when these resources are
synced, they are only synced in read-only mode. No changes to the resource in the virtual cluster syncs back to the host cluster as the
resources are shared across the host cluster.

A good example would be nodes, which are nice to view inside the virtual cluster and can be also used to enabled certain features such as [scheduling inside the vCluster](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/other/advanced/virtual-scheduler.mdx),
but you wouldn't want your virtual cluster to change the node itself. Another benefit of only syncing from host is that vCluster itself only requires read-only RBAC permissions.

vCluster also allows to sync custom resources via the [custom resource definitions syncer](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/custom-resources.mdx)

There are a couple of labels that are created on the host cluster by vCluster that never get synced to the virtual cluster resource. These labels are:

* `release` (Label is needed to avoid conflicts with the vCluster pods themselves).
* `vcluster.loft.sh/namespace`
* `vcluster.loft.sh/managed-by`
* `vcluster.loft.sh/controlled-by`
* `vcluster.loft.sh/ns-label-*`
These labels are added as management labels when synching from the virtual cluster to the host cluster, but skipped when syncing from the host cluster to the virtual 
cluster to prevent sync loops. 

### Resource creation behavior
#### Cluster-scoped resources
The following resources are not created during sync if they don’t already exist in the virtual cluster:
- [CSINodes](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/csi-nodes.mdx)
- [CSIDrivers](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/csi-drivers.mdx)

The following resouces are created in the virtual cluster as read-only if they don't already exist during the sync:
- [Nodes](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes.mdx)
- [IngressClasses](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/ingress-classes.mdx)
- [StorageClasses](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/storage-classes.mdx)
- Cluster-scoped [CustomResources](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/custom-resources.mdx)

#### Namespaced resources
Namespaced resources are automatically created in the virtual cluster if they do not already exist. Before synchronization occurs, the mapping between the host cluster source namespace name and the corresponding virtual cluster target namespace name must be defined.
This applies to:
- [Events](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/events.mdx)
- [ConfigMaps](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/configmaps.mdx)
- [Secrets](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/secrets.mdx)
- Namespace-scoped [CustomResources](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/custom-resources.mdx)

For CSIStorageCapacities, synchronization occurs only when a corresponding mapping exists between the physical StorageClass name in the host cluster and the StorageClass name in the virtual cluster and 
the capacity aligns with the associated physical node:
- [CSIStorageCapacities](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/csi-storage-capacities.mdx)

* [IngressClasses](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/ingress-classes.mdx)
* [StorageClasses](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/storage-classes.mdx)
* [CSINodes](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/csi-nodes.mdx)
* [CSIDrivers](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/csi-drivers.mdx)
* [CSIStorageCapacities](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/csi-storage-capacities.mdx)
* [ConfigMaps](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/configmaps.mdx)
* [Secrets](../configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/secrets.mdx)

### No bi-directional syncing

Since syncing resources from the host cluster is in read only mode and changes in the virtual cluster do not
get applied to the resource in the host cluster, bi-directional syncing does not exist across these resources.
