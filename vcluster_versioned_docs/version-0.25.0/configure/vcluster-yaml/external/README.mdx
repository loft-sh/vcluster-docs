## External integrations

The `external` section configures tools and services that are external to vCluster itself. Currently, this includes platform-specific features.

### Platform integration

The platform integration enables advanced features when using vCluster with the vCluster Platform:

- **[API key](./platform/api-key)** - Configure platform access credentials
- **[Auto sleep](./platform/auto-sleep)** - Automatically sleep inactive virtual clusters
- **[Auto delete](./platform/auto-delete)** - Automatically delete inactive virtual clusters

These features require a vCluster Platform installation and proper authentication.

:::info
Platform features help manage virtual clusters at scale by automating lifecycle operations such as sleep and deletion based on inactivity or schedules.
