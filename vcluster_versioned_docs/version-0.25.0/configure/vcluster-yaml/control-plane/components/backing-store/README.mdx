import BackingStore from '../../../../../_partials/config/controlPlane/backingStore.mdx'


Each virtual cluster requires a backing store and vCluster provides two different types of backing store options:

* [etcd](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/database) 
* [database](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/database)

There are different ways to deploy the type of backing store.

By default, vCluster uses an embedded SQLite database as the backing store. This option is great for smaller sandbox virtual clusters, but for production, it's recommended to use a different backing store option.
