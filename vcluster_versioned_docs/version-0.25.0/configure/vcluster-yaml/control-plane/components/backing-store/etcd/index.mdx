# etcd

If you choose etcd as your backing store, there are two deployment options:

- [Embedded](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/embedded): etcd is deployed as part of the virtual cluster control plane pod.
- [Deploy](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/deploy): etcd is deployed as a separate component.
