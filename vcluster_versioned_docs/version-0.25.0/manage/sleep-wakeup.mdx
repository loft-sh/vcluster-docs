The sleep mode **temporarily scales down** a virtual cluster and deletes all its created workloads on the host cluster. This approach helps **save computing resources** used by virtual cluster workloads in the host cluster. For example, sleeping development clusters during non-working hours can significantly reduce infrastructure costs. 

For more details on automating sleep mode operations in vCluster, see the [Sleep mode documentation](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sleep-mode).

- `vCluster` CLI

## Put a vCluster to sleep

Put a virtual cluster to sleep with the `vCluster` CLI:

```bash title="Sleep a virtual cluster"
vcluster platform sleep my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```

:::tip CLI reference
<!-- vale off -->
Read about using the [vcluster platform sleep](/vcluster/cli/vcluster_platform_sleep) command.
<!-- vale on -->
:::

This command performs the following actions:
- Scales down any StatefulSets or Deployments in the virtual cluster
- Deletes all workloads created by the virtual cluster on the host cluster

While the command preserves object definitions within the virtual cluster, any standalone pods (those without a controlling replica set or StatefulSet) needs to be restarted when the cluster wakes up.

:::warning Restarting pods
When pods are restarted:
- The temporary filesystem is erased
- Pod IP addresses change

## Wake up a vCluster

You can wake up a virtual cluster with two different `vCluster` CLI commands.

As soon as the virtual cluster is woken up, `vCluster` scales up any paused StatefulSets or Deployments and the `vCluster` syncer recreates the `vCluster` pods onto the host cluster.

### Direct wake up

Wake up the virtual cluster with a `vCluster` CLI command:

```bash title="Wake up a virtual cluster"
vcluster platform wakeup my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```

:::tip CLI reference
<!-- vale off -->
Read about using the [vcluster platform wakeup](/vcluster/cli/vcluster_platform_wakeup) command.
<!-- vale on -->
:::

### Connect to wake up

Connect to the virtual cluster with a `vCluster` CLI command, which automatically wakes up the virtual cluster:

```bash title="Connect to wake up a virtual cluster"
vcluster connect my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```
