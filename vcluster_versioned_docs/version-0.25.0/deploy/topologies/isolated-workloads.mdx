vCluster offers several different policies to automatically isolate workloads in a virtual
cluster. For all options within each policy, review the [policies documentation](../../configure/vcluster-yaml/policies/).

## Isolating your Workloads

In order to isolate workloads on a vCluster, you will need to enable a couple of configuration options. 

1. Set a [Pod Security Standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)
for the syncer component. If you enable either `baseline` or `restricted` policy, it will follow the standards outlined in Kubernetes. For exampke, with `baseline` as a Pod Security Standard,
pods that try to run as a privileged
container or mount a host path will not be synced to the host cluster. Though Pod Security Standard is a Kubernetes concept and only applicable
to certain versions of Kubernetes, vCluster supports this regardless of Kubernetes version as this is directly implemented in vCluster. Rejected 
pods will stay pending in the vCluster and in newer Kubernetes version they will be denied by the admission controller
as well.
2. Enable a [resource quota](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
as well as a [limit range](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/). This allows restricting resource consumption of
vCluster workloads. If enabled, sane defaults for those 2 resources are chosen.
3. Enable a [network policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
that restricts access of vCluster workloads as well as the
vCluster control plane to other pods in the host cluster. This only works if your host
[cluster CNI supports network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#prerequisites).

### Example `vcluster.yaml`

Enabling the recommended settings for workload isolation.

```yaml
policies:
  # empty, baseline, restricted can be used here
  podSecurityStandard: baseline

  resourceQuota:
    enabled: true

  limitRange:
    enabled: true

  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
```

:::info
When enabling resource quotas locally, make sure to add a `--expose-local=false`
flag to your `vcluster create [...]` command, as by default the vCluster CLI
will try to automatically expose the vCluster using NodePorts, when interacting
with a local Kubernetes cluster.

## Network Only Isolation

Workloads created by vCluster will be able to communicate with other workloads in
the host cluster through their cluster IPs. This can be sometimes beneficial if
you want to purposely access a host cluster service, which is a good method to
share services between virtual clusters. However, you often want to isolate namespaces
and do not want the pods running inside vCluster to have access to other workloads
in the host cluster. This requirement can be accomplished by using [Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
for the namespace where vCluster is installed in.

vCluster can automatically deploy a network policy in your host cluster by enabling the
following option in your `vcluster.yaml`:

```yaml
policies:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
  
```

:::warning
Network policies do not work in all Kubernetes clusters and need to be supported
by the underlying CNI plugin.

## Advanced Isolation

Besides the basic workload isolation using Pod Security Standard and Resource Quotas, you could always set more advanced
isolation methods, i.e. isolating the workloads on separate nodes or through
another container runtime.

You should be aware that pods created in the vCluster will set their
[tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/),
which will affect scheduling decisions. To prevent the pods from being scheduled
to the undesirable nodes, you can use the `sync.fromHost.nodes.selector.labels`
option or admission controller.

### Workload & Network Isolation within the vCluster

The above mentioned methods also work for isolating workloads inside the vCluster
itself, as you can just deploy resource quotas, limit ranges, admission controllers
and network policies in there. To allow network policies to function correctly,
you'll need to enable these configuration options in your vcluster.yaml.

### Secret based Service Account tokens

By default, vCluster will create Service Account Tokens for each pod and inject
them as an annotation in the respective pod's metadata. If this doesn't comply
with your security practices, then  you can mitigate this by enabling an option
in the `vcluster.yaml` which creates separate secrets for each pod's
Service Account Token and mounts it accordingly using projected volumes. This can be enabled in your `vcluster.yaml`:

```yaml
sync:
  toHost:
    pods:
      useSecretsForSATokens: true
```
