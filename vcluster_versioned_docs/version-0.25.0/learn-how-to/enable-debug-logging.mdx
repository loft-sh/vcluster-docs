# Enable debug logging in vCluster

Debug logging helps troubleshoot issues in vCluster. Enabling debug logging in vCluster helps diagnose and resolve issues more effectively. Adding the `DEBUG` environment variable to the vCluster configuration increases log verbosity and provides deeper insights.

This guide demonstrates how to enable debug logging by changing the vCluster configuration.

## Common issues to investigate

Debug logs are particularly helpful for investigating:

- Synchronization problems between vCluster and host cluster.
- Authentication and authorization issues.
- Resource creation failures.
- Networking and connectivity problems.
- API server request handling.

## Configure debug logging

<Flow id="enable-debug-logging">
<Step>
**Edit the vCluster configuration**.

Open the configuration file `vcluster.yaml` or the Helm values file you used during installation.
</Step>

<Step>
**Add the debug flag**.

Modify the configuration to include the debug environment variable:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    env:
    - name: "DEBUG"
      value: "true"
```
</Step>

<Step>
**Apply the configuration**.

Run this command to apply the updated configuration:

```bash
helm upgrade <vcluster-helm-release-name> loft/vcluster -n <vcluster-namespace> -f vcluster.yaml
```

- Replace `<vcluster-helm-release-name>` and `<vcluster-namespace>` with your actual values.
</Step>
</Flow>

## View debug logs

After enabling debug logging, view the logs with the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs -n <vcluster-namespace> <vcluster-pod-name>
```

You'll see more detailed logs that include `DEBUG` level information.
