description: How to programmatically check if the Kubernetes cluster you are connected to is vCluster.
---

When working with Kubernetes clusters, you can determine if you're connected to a vCluster or host cluster using the following methods:

- **Method 1**: [Check node labels](#check-node-labels) - Examine node labels for vCluster-specific indicators
- **Method 2**: [Examine the current context](#examine-context) - Look for vCluster naming patterns in your kubectl context
- **Method 3**: [List all contexts](#parse-contexts) - Get a comprehensive view of available vCluster contexts

## Check for vCluster node labels {#check-node-labels}

Retrieve the nodes and check for a vCluster node label:

```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep vcluster
```

If this command returns results, you're likely connected to a vCluster. This method works in most cases but might not be entirely reliable.

## Examine the current context {#examine-context}

For scripting purposes, you can check the current context:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```

If the output contains "vcluster" (for example, `vcluster_vcluster-xx5gk`), you're connected to a vCluster.

## Parse all contexts {#parse-contexts}

To get a more comprehensive view, you can list all contexts and search for "vcluster":

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts | grep vcluster
```

This shows all vCluster contexts available.

## Implement check in a script

Here's a simple bash script that combines these methods:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check current context
current_context=$(kubectl config current-context)
if [[ $current_context == *"vcluster"* ]]; then
    echo "Connected to vCluster: $current_context"
    exit 0
fi

# Check for vCluster node labels
vcluster_nodes=$(kubectl get nodes --show-labels | grep vcluster)
if [ ! -z "$vcluster_nodes" ]; then
    echo "Connected to vCluster (detected via node labels)"
    exit 0
fi

echo "Connected to host cluster"
exit 1
```

This script first checks the current context name. If that doesn't indicate a vCluster, it then checks for vCluster node labels. If neither method detects a vCluster, it assumes you're connected to the host cluster.

## Additional tools

While not directly applicable for scripting, the following tools can help with manual context switching and management:

- Install kubectl plugins using [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/)
- Use [kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) for easier context switching

These tools are particularly useful when working with multiple clusters or contexts in a development environment.
