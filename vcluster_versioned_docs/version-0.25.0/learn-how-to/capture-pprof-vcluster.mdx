<!-- vale off -->

This guide shows how to use Performance Profiling in Go (pprof) to capture CPU and memory profiles from vCluster. Capturing [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) is important for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing resource usage. 

When vCluster experiences high CPU or memory usage, use profiling to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize resource consumption.

## Set up and capture pprof on vCluster 

### Enable verbose logging and pprof endpoint

To make the logging more verbose and to enable the endpoint that serves pprof data, add the following environment variable in the Helm chart values:

```yaml
controlPlane:
  statefulSet:
    env:
    - name: "DEBUG"
      value: "true"
```

:::note
You must be on the kube-context of the host cluster where the vCluster is running.

### Port forwarding

If you're not using the templates from the UI, you can execute the following commands from your terminal:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n vclusternamespace pod/vclustername-0 10443:8443
```

This command allows you to access services running inside the virtual cluster from your local machine without exposing them publicly through the host Kubernetes clusterâ€™s services or ingress.

If a template is not used, the values should be added directly to `.spec.template.helmRelease.values` in the `VirtualClusterInstance`.

### Capture a CPU profile

Run the following command locally:

```sh
curl -k "https://localhost:10443/debug/pprof/profile?second=60" > profile60.prof
```

This command fetches a CPU profile of the vCluster pod's processes (such as the virtual Kubernetes API server) for the past 60 seconds. A `profile60.prof` file is created on your local system.

### Capture a memory profile

In the terminal from your local, execute:

```sh
curl -k https://localhost:10443/debug/pprof/heap -o heapprofile.prof
```

This command fetches a heap profile from the vCluster pod by sending a request to the `/debug/pprof/heap` endpoint. You should see a `heapprofile.prof` file created on your local system.


## Next steps

After you've captured these files, you can [send them to us](https://loft-sh.slack.com/). This enables us to identify opportunities for optimization and enhance the performance of your application.
