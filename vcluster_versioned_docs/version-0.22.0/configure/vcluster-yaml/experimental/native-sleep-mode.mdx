:::warning
Native sleep mode is intended for pre-production use cases only, and comes with some limitations and
caveats.
:::

### Configuration examples



```yaml title="Sleep after 3 hours of inactivity, anything that does not have the label dont=sleep"
experimental:
  sleepMode:
    enabled: true
    autoSleep:
      afterInactivity: 3h  # Uses Go's Duration with a max unit of hour
      exclude:
        selector:
          labels:
            dont: sleep
```



```yaml title="Sleep every Friday at 17:30 and wake every Monday at 7:00 in Mountain timezone"
experimental:
  sleepMode:
    enabled: true
    timezone: America/Denver
    autoSleep:
      schedule: 30 17 * * 5
      wakeup:
        schedule: 0 7 * * 1
```

### How it works

**Sleeping** deletes bare pods and scale down the following resources:
  * Deployments
  * ReplicaSets
  * ReplicationControllers
  * DaemonSets

**Waking** scales those resources back up, but it will be unable to restore bare pods.  To exempt resources from being
put to sleep, either add the annotation `sleepmode.loft.sh/exclude: true` or configure sleep mode with labels to exclude and
add that label to all the workloads you'd like to keep running.

### Detecting activity

To wake a sleeping cluster or to update the last active time, native sleep mode captures the following:

 * Access of cluster resources.  _Think `kubectl get <resource>`_
 * Attempts to contact Ingress endpoints (NGINX only).

:::note
Ingress activity detection is only available for [NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main)
ingress controllers, making use of the [mirror-target](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#mirror)
annotation.  If you use this annotation, it will be overwritten for the sleep mode to function.
:::

### Ingress considerations

If you install your ingress controller(s) in the vCluster you'll need to exempt the controller from sleeping so it remains
active for requests that would wake the vCluster.  If you install the ingress controller in the host cluster, you'll need to
enable syncing ingresses to the host.

```yaml title="enable ingress syncing"
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```
