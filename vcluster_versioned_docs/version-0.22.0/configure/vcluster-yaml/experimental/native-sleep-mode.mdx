:::warning
Native sleep mode is intended for pre-production use cases only, and comes with some limitations and
caveats.
:::


### How it works

**Sleeping** deletes bare pods and scales down the following resources:
  * Deployments
  * ReplicaSets
  * ReplicationControllers
  * DaemonSets

**Waking** scales sleeping resources back up, however bare pods that were killed cannot be restored.  To exempt resources from being
put to sleep, either add the annotation `sleepmode.loft.sh/exclude: true` or configure `sleepMode` with a label, or set
of labels to exclude and add those labels to all the workloads you'd like to keep running.

### Detecting activity

To wake a sleeping cluster or to update the last active time, native sleep mode captures the following:

 * Access of cluster resources.  _Think `kubectl get <resource>`_
 * Attempts to contact Ingress endpoints (NGINX only).

:::note
Ingress activity detection is only available for [NGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/main)
ingress controllers, making use of the [mirror-target](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#mirror)
annotation.  This has the effect of overwriting any previously set mirror-target annotation.

### Ingress considerations

#### Sync to host

If you install your ingress controllers in the vCluster you'll need to exempt the controller from sleeping so it remains
active for requests that would wake the vCluster.  If you install the `Ingress` controller in the host cluster, you'll need to
enable syncing ingresses to the host.

```yaml title="enable ingress syncing"
sync:
  toHost:
    ingresses:
      enabled: true
```

#### Reachability

In order to detect ingress activity, the vCluster pod must be discoverable by the ingress controller. i.e. an `nslookup` for the
`<vcluster-namespace>.<vcluster-svc-name>.svc.cluster.local` should be able to find the vCluster service.  If you're installing
the ingress controller with Helm be sure to set the `dnsPolicy` correctly, as is covered in the ingress example.

### Additional examples

```yaml title="Sleep after 3 hours of inactivity, anything that does not have the label dont=sleep"
experimental:
  sleepMode:
    enabled: true
    autoSleep:
      afterInactivity: 3h  # Uses Go's Duration with a max unit of hour
      exclude:
        selector:
          labels:
            dont: sleep
```

```yaml title="Sleep every Friday at 17:30 and wake every Monday at 7:00 in Mountain timezone"
experimental:
  sleepMode:
    enabled: true
    timezone: America/Denver
    autoSleep:
      schedule: 30 17 * * 5
      wakeup:
        schedule: 0 7 * * 1
```
