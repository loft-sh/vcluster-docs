Most resources inside your virtual cluster only exist in your virtual cluster and not in the host cluster.


To verify this, perform these steps:

<Flow>
   <Step>
      Switch your kube context from the virtual cluster to the host cluster by disconnecting.

      ```bash
      vcluster disconnect
      ```
   </Step>
   <Step>
      Check the namespaces in the host cluster to confirm you are in the correct kube context.

      ```bash
      kubectl get namespaces
      ```
      Output is similar to:
      ```bash
      NAME                 STATUS   AGE
      default              Active   35m
      kube-public          Active   35m
      kube-system          Active   35m
      # highlight-next-line
      team-x               Active   30m
      ```
   </Step>
   <Step>
      Look at all the deployments in the `team-x` namespace to see if the `nginx-deployment` deployment was deployed on the host cluster.

      ```bash
      kubectl get deployments -n team-x
      ```

      Notice that this `deployment` resource does **not** exist in the host cluster. By default, it does not get synced from the virtual cluster to the host cluster because it isn't required to run this workload in the host cluster.

   </Step>
   <Step>
      Now, look for the NGINX pods on the host cluster.

      ```bash
      kubectl get pods -n team-x
      ```

      Output is similar to:

      ```bash
      coredns-cb5ccc67f-kqwmx-x-kube-system-x-my-vcluster            1/1     Running   0          34m
      my-vcluster-0                                                  1/1     Running   0          34m
      nginx-deployment-6d6565499c-cbv4w-x-demo-nginx-x-my-vcluster   1/1     Running   0          20m
      nginx-deployment-6d6565499c-s7g8z-x-demo-nginx-x-my-vcluster   1/1     Running   0          20m
      ```

      You can see from the output that the the two NGINX pods exist in the host cluster. To prevent collisions, the pod names and their namespaces are rewritten by vCluster during the sync process from the virtual cluster to the host cluster.


:::info vCluster Control Plane
The vCluster `my-cluster-0` pod is also known as the vCluster control plane.

When a local persistent storage is needed, a virtual cluster is deployed as a
[StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/),
which provides stable, unique pod identities including a persistent volume.
StatefulSets ensure that each vCluster pod maintains a consistent network identity and, when configured, persistent storage.
This is essential for vClusterâ€™s internal data, as it utilizes
[Kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine), a shim between Kubernetes and relational
databases, along with an embedded SQLite database (`state.db`) to store state information.

However when no local persistent storage is needed, as is in the case of
external database, a  virtual cluster is deployed as a
[Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

By default, vCluster does not persist data outside of its pods.
Consequently, deleting a vCluster pod without persistent storage results in data
loss. You can configure external [backingStore](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/) to persist data outside of the
pod.
