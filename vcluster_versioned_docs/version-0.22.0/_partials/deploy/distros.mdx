vCluster is deployed with its own Kubernetes distribution that does not need to match with the host cluster's distribution. For example, you can deploy virtual clusters with the k8s distro on top of EKS clusters.


:::warning
After deploying your vCluster, changing the Kubernetes distribution of vCluster is not supported.
:::

By default, the distribution of vCluster is vanilla Kubernetes (k8s) and is the recommended distribution to use.

The following distributions are supported for virtual clusters:

- k8s: By default, the vCluster distribution is vanilla Kubernetes, which is the recommended distribution to use.
- [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s): A highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.
- [k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s): An all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. Please note that dual stack networking is not supported with k0s, you will be able to deploy it on a dual stack host cluster, but it will not have all the dual stack features.

**Note:**
<HostClusterCompat distro="any supported Kubernetes distribution"/>
### Host cluster compatibility

vCluster should work when deployed on a host cluster with the following supported Kubernetes versions:
