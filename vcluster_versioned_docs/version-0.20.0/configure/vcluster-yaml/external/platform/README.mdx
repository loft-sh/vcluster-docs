You can connect to [vCluster Platform](/platform/) through the `vcluster.yaml` and configure different
vCluster Platform settings that work with the virtual cluster.

## Example

With this example, you can set the vCluster to automatically sleep after 10 minutes.

```yaml
external:
  platform:
    autoSleep:
      schedule: * 17 * * * # Sleep at 5 PM
      autoWakeup:
        schedule: * 9 * * * # Wakeup at 9 AM
```

## Config reference
