You can modify the sync behaviour with patches that target specific paths. Currently there is 2 different kinds of patches supported.

:::info Wildcard patches
You can use `*` in paths to select all entries of an array or object, e.g. `spec.containers[*].name` or `spec.containers[*].volumeMounts[*]`. vCluster calls the patch multiple times when using the wildcard reference.

### JavaScript Expression Patches

These are powerful JavaScript ES6 compatible expression patches that can be used to change a field while syncing. You define how it changes when syncing from the virtual cluster into the host cluster or when syncing from the host cluster into the virtual cluster. To change the path <span>{props.path}</span> you can do:
<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`sync:
  toHost:
    ${props.resource}:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: ${props.path}
        expression: '"my-prefix-"+value'
        # optional reverseExpression to reverse the change from the host cluster
        # reverseExpression: 'value.slice("my-prefix".length)'`}
</CodeBlock>

There is also a variable called `context` besides `value` that can be used to access specific data of the virtual cluster:
* `context.vcluster.name`: Name of the virtual cluster
* `context.vcluster.namespace`: Namespace of the virtual cluster
* `context.vcluster.config`: Config of the virtual cluster, basically `vcluster.yaml` merged with the defaults
* `context.hostObject`: Host object (can be null if not available)
* `context.virtualObject`: Virtual object (can be null if not available)
* `context.path`: The matched path on the object, useful when using wildcard path selectors (*)

### Reference patches

A reference patch can be used to have a specific field of one resource point to a different resource that should get rewritten. vCluster automatically imports the referenced resource to the virtual cluster if it can find it in the host cluster. For example:
<CodeBlock language="yaml">
{`sync:
  toHost:
    ${props.resource}:
      enabled: true
      patches:
      - path: metadata.annotations["my-secret-ref"]
        reference:
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Secret`}
</CodeBlock>

With this yaml, vCluster translates the path `metadata.annotations["my-secret-ref"]` as it points to a secret. If the secret is created in the host cluster, vCluster automatically imports it into the virtual cluster.

:::info Multi-Namespace-Mode
With multi-namespace-mode you only need to rewrite references that include a namespace. You can use the `namespacePath` option to specify the path of the namespace of the reference.
