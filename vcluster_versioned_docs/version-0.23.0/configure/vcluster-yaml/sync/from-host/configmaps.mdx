:::info No need to configure RBAC
vCluster automatically adds the required cluster RBAC permissions for retrieving the ConfigMaps and syncing the resources from the host to the virtual cluster.
:::

Enabling sync from host allows you to sync ConfigMaps from the specified namespaces in the host cluster to the specified namespaces in a virtual cluster.
Here is how the required configuration in `vcluster.yaml` looks like:
```yaml title="configure ConfigMap sync from host"
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        mappings:
          # syncs all ConfigMaps from "foo" namespace
          # to the "bar" namespace in a virtual cluster. ConfigMaps names are unchanged.
          "foo/*": "bar/*"
```

Here are a few things to remember when configuring the sync:
- It is also possible to modify the name of the synced resource in the virtual cluster.
- There is no option to sync from all namespaces in the host.
- Sync is one-directional, from host to virtual. If you modify an object in the host, vCluster syncs the change to virtual object.
- When you delete a virtual object, vCluster re-creates it if the host object still exist.
- When you delete a host object, vCluster deletes the corresponding virtual object.
- It is not possible to sync ConfigMaps that were already synced from virtual to host, they are skipped by vCluster.

Namespaces in the virtual cluster are created automatically during the sync (if they do not exist already).

:::info kube-root-ca ConfigMap is skipped
ConfigMaps named `kube-root-ca.crt` are skipped in the from host sync (even if they match the mappings specified in `vcluster.yaml`).
:::

You can use synced ConfigMaps in your workloads as an environment variables source or a volume.

## Prerequisites
<BasePrerequisites />
All the specified namespaces have to exist in the host at the vCluster startup.


## Sync all ConfigMaps from host namespace
To sync all ConfigMaps from a given namespace in the host to the given namespace in the virtual cluster, use “namespace/*” wildcard, e.g.:

```yaml title="configure ConfigMap sync from host namespace"
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      mappings:
        byName:
          # syncs all ConfigMaps from "foo" namespace
          # to the "bar" namespace in a virtual cluster. ConfigMaps names are unchanged.
          "foo/*": "bar/*"
```

## Sync only specific ConfigMaps from host namespace
To sync only specific ConfigMaps from namespaces, you need to provide `namespace/name` as the key and value:

```yaml title="configure ConfigMap sync from host for one object"
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      mappings:
        byName:
          # syncs ConfigMap named "cm-name" from "foo" host namespace
          # to the "bar" namespace in virtual.
          "foo/cm-name": "bar/cm-name"
```

## Sync all ConfigMaps from virtual cluster's host namespace
There is also a handy syntax to sync all ConfigMaps from virtual cluster’s own host namespace to the virtual namespace. As virtual cluster’s namespace is not always known upfront (e.g. when virtual cluster is created by the platform), `""` (empty string) is treated as “virtual cluster’s own host namespace”.

```yaml title="configure ConfigMap sync from host for virtual cluster's namespace"
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      mappings:
        byName:
          # syncs all ConfigMaps from virtual cluster's host namespace
          # to "my-virtual" namespace in a virtual cluster.
          "": "my-virtual"
```

## Sync specific ConfigMap from virtual cluster's host namespace
you can also specify only a few ConfigMaps from virtual cluster’s own host namespace this way:

```yaml title="configure ConfigMap sync from host for objects in virtual cluster's namespace"
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      mappings:
        byName:
          # syncs ConfigMap named "my-cm" from virtual cluster's host namespace
          # to "my-virtual-namespace" in a virtual cluster.
          "/my-cm": "my-virtual/my-cm"
```

## Modify synced ConfigMap namespace and name in the virtual cluster
It’s also possible to modify ConfigMap name during the sync:

```yaml title="configure ConfigMap sync from host and modify name and namespace"
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      mappings:
        byName:
          # syncs "config" ConfigMap from "cert-manager" namespace in the host
          # as "my-config" in "my-virtual" namespace in a virtual cluster.
          "cert-manager/config": "my-virtual/my-config"
```

## Patches

<ProAdmonition/>

You can specify `reverseExpression` in the `sync.fromHost.configMaps.patches` .

They are applied on the host object and appear in the virtual object.

`expressions` have no effect.

So, for the following `vcluster.yaml` :

```yaml title="configure ConfigMap sync from host with patches"
sync:
  fromHost:
    configMaps:
      enabled: true
      mappings:
        byName:
          "default/my-cm": "barfoo2/cm-my"
      patches:
        - path: metadata.annotations[*]
          # optional reverseExpression to reverse the change from the host cluster
          reverseExpression: "value.startsWith('www.') ? value.slice(4) : value"
```

1. Your ConfigMap in the host namespace `default` named `my-cm` is synced to the namespace `barfoo2` in virtual and named `cm-my`.
2. If `default/my-cm` host object has annotation which value starts with `www.` , e.g.: `my-address: www.loft.sh` then synced object in the virtual cluster `barfoo2/cm-my` has annotation `my-address: loft.sh` .
