description: Intro to the vcluster.yaml configuration file
---

The `vcluster.yaml` file contains all configuration options when deploying, making changes or upgrading a virtual cluster. It's an optional file passed to any deployment method, and without this file, a virtual cluster is created with a set of default values.

Example configuration options include the vCluster control plane's [backing store](./vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/), resource syncing behavior [from](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/) and [to](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/) the host cluster, and exporting the virtual cluster's [kubeconfig](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/export-kube-config) file. Benefits of this file include:

- **Unified Configuration:** All settings for vCluster in one place, simplifying management.
- **Schema Validation:** Automatically validate the configuration when using the vCluster CLI.
- **IDE Support:** Integrated schema with popular IDEs for autocompletion and validation.

#### Example `vcluster.yaml` file

```yaml
controlPlane:
  backingStore: # This backing store option is a Pro feature and requires a license. Remove it if you don't have a license.
    etcd:
      embedded: 
        enabled: true
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    host: vcluster-k8s-api.example.com
sync:
  toHost:
    serviceAccounts:
      enabled: true
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      clearImageStatus: true
exportKubeConfig:
  context: my-vcluster-context
  server: https://vcluster-k8s-api.example.com
  secret:
    name: my-vcluster-kubeconfig
```

This example configuration defines:
1. [Embedded etcd](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/components/backing-store/etcd/embedded) as the vCluster control plane's backing store to reduce management overhead (Pro feature).
1. Syncing [ServiceAccount](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/to-host/advanced/service-accounts) resources from the virtual to the host cluster, to support.
1. Deploying an [Ingress](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/deployment/ingress) resource on the host cluster to expose the vCluster control plane's API server as a hostname.
1. Syncing real [node](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/sync/from-host/nodes) data, rather than the default "pseudo" nodes, but clears the `ImageStatuses` field within the `NodeStatus` of the synced nodes.
1. How to export the [kubeconfig](/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/export-kube-config) file to a secret, so you can use it, for example, in your ArgoCD or Terraform pipelines.

## How to Use `vcluster.yaml`

### Create a New Virtual Cluster 
After defining your configuration options in your `vcluster.yaml`, you can [deploy a new virtual cluster](../deploy/basics/). 

### Apply Changes to an existing Virtual Cluster
If you've already deployed a virtual cluster and discover new configuration options that you want to apply, you can update your `vcluster.yaml` and then 
[deploy those new changes](../manage/deploy-changes/). 


## FAQs

### How do I upgrade my 0.19.x and earlier virtual cluster configurations?

Since the deployment of vCluster has significantly changed from a combination of CLI flags, annotations and various `values.yaml` files based on distro, any old `values.yaml` will not be 
usable with v0.20. If you have existing 0.19.x virtual clusters, you must convert the old configuration `values.yaml` to the new v0.20 format before attempting to upgrade.


[View the conversion guide](/vcluster/reference/migrations/0-20-migration) for more details.

<p></p>

:::warning
Pre-v0.20.0 `values.yaml` files are not compatible with v0.20.0. You need to convert to the new format in order to use the new vCluster CLI and upgrade existing vCluster instances.
:::

### Is it required to provide a `vcluster.yaml` file?
No, if a `vcluster.yaml` file isn't provided, the vCluster will be created using a set of default values.

### Can I change the configuration for existing virtual clusters?
Yes, you can run `vcluster create VCLUSTER_NAME --upgrade -f vcluster.yaml`
