In order to deploy vCluster, you need the following:

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
* [Helm v3.10.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* Access to a Kubernetes v1.28+ cluster with permissions to deploy applications into a namespace. This is considered the host cluster for the vCluster deployment.
