Bringing up a Kubernetes cluster can face challenges, so here are some troubleshooting tips to help get you started. 

## Check vCluster logs

All vCluster logs are located in the control plane, view service logs using journalctl.

```bash title="View vCluster service logs"
journalctl -u vcluster.service --since="2 minutes ago" -f
```

## Common Issues

### Network connectivity

Ensure ports 6443 (API Server) and other required ports are accessible

### SystemD service

The vCluster service needs to be running at all times.

```bash title="Verify the vCluster service is running
systemctl status vcluster.service
```

### Node join failures

Check that join tokens haven't expired and network connectivity exists between nodes.

When running the join node script, if a 400 status code is received, check the URL directly to see if an error message exists. Alternatively you can pipe the entire response to the terminal and print it:

```bash Print node join response
curl -sSLk "https://<endpoint>/node/join?token=<token>" | { response=$(cat); echo "$response" | sh - 2>/dev/null || echo "Error: $response"; }
```

### Resource constraints

Ensure adequate CPU, memory, and disk space on nodes.
