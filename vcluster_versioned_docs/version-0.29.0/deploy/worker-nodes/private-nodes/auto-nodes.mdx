## Install vCluster Platform

vCluster needs to be connected to a running vCluster Platform to enable configuring
for nodes to automatically provision based on resource needs.

Follow our [guide on installing vCluster Platform](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/install/quick-start-guide). 

## Create a node provider

After vCluster Platform is installed, a node provider needs to be created in order for virtual clusters
to reference in the `vcluster.yaml` configuration. 

Read more about [node providers](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/platform/administer/node-providers/overview) and create one.

## Create a vCluster 

Now that vCluster Platform is created with a node provider, you can start creating virtual clusters
that are configured with to have automatic nodes join. The virtual clusters must either be created 
through the vCluster Platform or connected to the vCluster Platform using an [API key](../../../configure/vcluster-yaml/external/platform/api-key). 

Read through the [auto nodes configuration details](../../../configure/vcluster-yaml/private-nodes/auto-nodes) to learn 
about how to configure your node pools and how to define which nodes from the node provider should be configured.
