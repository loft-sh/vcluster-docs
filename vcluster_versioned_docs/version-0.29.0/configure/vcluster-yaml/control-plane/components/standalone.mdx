## Node Roles

By default, the node only acts as a control plane node, but can be enabled to run as a 
worker node as well. 

```yaml title="Allow control plane node to be a worker node"
controlPlane:
  standalone:
    enabled: true
    joinNode: 
      enabled: true  # Control Plane node will also be considered a worker node 
privateNodes: # Required when adding additional worker nodes
  enabled: true
```
