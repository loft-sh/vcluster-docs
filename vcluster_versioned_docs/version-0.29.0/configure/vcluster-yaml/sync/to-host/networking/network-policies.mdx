By default, this is disabled.

Sync [NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) resources from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. This ensures correct policies are created in the host cluster to achieve the desired traffic behavior between pods.

### Sync NetworkPolicies from the virtual to host cluster

```YAML
sync:
  toHost:
    networkPolicies:
      enabled: true
```

:::info
NetworkPolicy resources inside virtual clusters rely on the host cluster's support for this feature. Make sure that your host cluster satisfies the [Network Policy prerequisites](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#prerequisites).
