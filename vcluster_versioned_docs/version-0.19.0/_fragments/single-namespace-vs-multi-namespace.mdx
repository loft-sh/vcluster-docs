### Single-Namespace Mode (default)

#### Choose this if you:

* Not want to sync any CRDs or just CRDs with only a few references to other resources (e.g. Cert Manager or External Secrets)
* Not have any global cluster permissions

#### Advantages:
* No cluster-level permissions required
* Single namespace per vCluster
* Easier isolation (single resource quota, limit range etc. per vCluster)

#### Disadvantages:
* Resource names on the host cluster are called differently than in the vCluster
* More complex to sync complex CRDs because of rewritten names (need to configure references on CRDs)

### Multi-Namespace Mode

#### Choose this if you:
* Want to sync more complex CRDs (e.g. Knative, Zalando Postgresql or Tekton)
* Are fine with vCluster creating new namespaces on its own

#### Advantages:
* Resource names on the host cluster are called the same than in the vCluster
* Easier to sync CRDs (no need to configure references)
* Easier migration of resources into the vCluster

#### Disadvantages:
* Requires global cluster permissions
* More effort to isolate multiple namespaces via quotas & policies
