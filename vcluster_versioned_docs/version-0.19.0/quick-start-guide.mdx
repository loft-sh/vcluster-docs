## Key Concepts

<KeyConcepts />

## Before you begin

<PreRequisites />

## Deploy vCluster

Deploy a vCluster instance called `my-vcluster` to namespace `team-x`. This guide uses the vCluster CLI to deploy vCluster, but there are multiple ways to deploy vCluster using other tools like Helm, Terraform, ArgoCD, ClusterAPI, etc. Read about the additional options in the [deployment section of the docs](./deploy/basics).

## Use your virtual cluster

After immediately creating your virtual cluster, your kube context is updated to point to the virtual cluster and all these commands are directed at the virtual cluster. 

### Deploy resources inside the virtual cluster

<DeployResources />

### View resources inside the host cluster

<ViewHostResources />

## Delete vCluster

Deleting a vCluster also deletes all resources within the virtual cluster and all states related to the vCluster. If the namespace on the host cluster was created by the vCluster CLI, then that namespace is also deleted. 

```bash
vcluster delete my-vcluster --namespace team-x
```
