import SyncNodes from '../../../../_partials/config/sync/fromHost/nodes.mdx'

{/*
`nodes.enabled`:
- covered by the generic section here: https://www.vcluster.com/docs/syncer/config#enable-or-disable-synced-resources
- exists from the beginning. I believe one would need this to schedule any pods
- may be possible to disable this in the "control plane" vCluster when using [Isolated Control Plane](https://www.vcluster.com/pro/docs/features/isolated_control_planes), where all the workloads are scheduled to the workload cluster (where nodes syncing would be enabled)

`nodes.syncBackChanges`:
- replaces deprecated flag `--sync-node-changes`
- enables syncing labels and taints from virtual cluster nodes to the host nodes
- requires adding rbac permissions to modify the host node & status

`nodes.clearImageStatus`:
- sets `--node-clear-image-status`, added with this PR: https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/pull/826
- description says it's to prevent information about the node from leaking in a multi-tenant environment

`nodes.selector.all`:
- sets `--sync-all-nodes` syncer flag, see also [Example: Sync All Nodes](https://www.vcluster.com/docs/architecture/nodes#example-sync-all-nodes)

`nodes.selector.labels`:
- selects node labels that will be synced to the vCluster. This allows controlling which nodes can be used by the vCluste
- Some example use cases:
  - only allow nodes in a region
  - only allow nodes with a particular architecture
  - only use spot instances
  - prevent vClusters from sharing resources with critical infrastructure
*/}

By default, this is disabled.

vCluster syncs psuedo nodes from the host cluster where there are virtual cluster pods running. Pseudo nodes only have real values for the CPU, architecture, and operating system, while everything else is randomly generated. A single pseudo node can either represent a single real node on the host cluster, or it can represent multiple real nodes. If there are no more pods on a node, vCluster deletes the pseudo node.

However, when you need to access specific node information, you can choose to sync real nodes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster. This requires a cluster role.

### Sync pseudo nodes (Default)

Sync pseudo nodes to the virtual cluster. This default configuration does not require a cluster role.

```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: false
```

vCluster ignores `selector.all` and `selector.labels`. However, if you create a pod with `spec.nodeSelector`, the syncer creates a pseudo node with annotations and labels based on the real node so that the pod's node selector references something that also exists in the virtual cluster.

See the Kubernetes docs for [spec.nodeSelector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) details.

### Sync real nodes

Sync real nodes to the virtual cluster where virtual cluster pods are running:
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
```

### Sync pseudo nodes with label selector

Sync pseudo nodes nodes that match a given label selector. This example sets the node selector to the same values when syncing a pod from virtual cluster to host cluster:
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: false
      selector:
        labels:
          environment: production
          team: backend
```

### Sync real nodes with label selector

Sync real nodes nodes that match a given label selector. This example sets the node selector to the same values when syncing a pod from virtual cluster to host cluster:
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        labels:
          environment: production
          team: backend
```

### Sync all real nodes

Sync all real nodes, regardless of whether a virtual cluster pod is running on it or not:
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      selector:
        all: true
```

### Sync real nodes and sync back labels and taints

Enable syncing real nodes from the host cluster to the virtual cluster as well as syncing back from the virtual cluster any changes to node labels and taints. Enabling this adds RBAC permissions to the syncer component to allow it to modify the host nodes and statuses.
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      syncBackChanges: true
```

### Sync real nodes and hide image information

Enable syncing real nodes. This clears all `status.images` from the node when it is synced to the virtual cluster. For certain multi-tenant use cases, such as multi-customer tenancy, images can leak sensitive information about a node.
```YAML
sync:
  fromHost:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
      clearImageStatus: true
```
