<ProAdmonition/>

The vCluster control plane runs in one cluster, while a second, headless vCluster instance runs workloads in a separate cluster.

## Key benefits

- **Optimize resource allocation**. Deploy control planes on cost-effective clusters and direct heavy-duty tasks, such as GPU-intensive workloads, to higher-performance clusters.

- **Simplify management**. Offer a straightforward, enforceable, alternative
to each developer managing increasingly complex amounts of taints, tolerations, or node affinities to schedule workloads to the appropriate clusters.

- **Enhance security with control**. Developers can manage workloads via the control plane, even if the workloads reside in a secure zone. This eliminates the need to provide developers with direct cluster access, firewall configurations, and permissions management.

- **Divide responsibilities**. Allow for a clear separation of duties, where one
team oversees the control plane cluster and other teams handle the workload clusters.

| Deprecated Parameter             | Config Field       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `--remote-kube-config`           | `kubeConfig`       |
| `--remote-namespace`             | `namespace`        |
| `--remote-service-name`          | `service`          |

## Configure remote virtual cluster as workload cluster

Create a virtual cluster with the following configuration, where the `headless` field is set to `true`:

```yaml
isolatedControlPlane:
  headless: true
```

Create a second virtual cluster with the following configuration, where the `enabled` field is set to `true`:

```yaml
isolatedControlPlane:
  enabled: true
  kubeConfig: VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG
  namespace: VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE
  service: VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_SERVICE
```

Replace the following:

- _`VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_KUBECONFIG`_: the location of the remote virtual cluster's kubeconfig file
  - Store the kubeconfig in a Secret or ConfigMap.
  - Mount the Secret or ConfigMap as a Volume available to the virtual cluster.
  - Configure the Volume as a VolumeMount in the syncer.
- _`VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_NAMESPACE`_: the remote virtual cluster's namespace
- _`VIRTUAL_CLUSTER_SERVICE`_: the remote vCluster Service name
