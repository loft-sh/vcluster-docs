In order to deploy vcluster, you need the following:

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
* [Helm v3.10.0+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* Access to a Kubernetes v1.28+ cluster with permissions to deploy applications into a namespace. This is considered the host cluster for the vCluster deployment.

:::tip Host Cluster Requirements
Since vCluster runs as an application, vCluster can run on any host cluster regardless of OS or Kubernetes distribution. The Kubernetes distribution of vCluster does not need to match the Kubernetes distribution of the host cluster. For example,
you can select a vCluster with `k8s` as the distro and run it on host cluster that's running EKS.
