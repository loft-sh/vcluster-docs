Sleeping a vCluster means to temporarily scale down the vCluster and delete all its created workloads on the host cluster. This can be useful to save computing resources used by vCluster workloads in the host cluster.

## Sleeping a vCluster

Put a vCluster to sleep with the vCluster CLI: 

```
vcluster sleep my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```

This command will do the following things:
1. Scale down any statefulset(s) or deployment(s) in the vCluster.  
2. Delete all workloads created by the vCluster on the host cluster.

The command leaves the objects within the vCluster untouched, which means that even single pods that were deployed within the vCluster without a controlling replica set or statefulset will be restarted.

:::warning Restarting pods
Since all the pods will be restarted, the temporary filesystem is erased and the pod IP will change.

## Waking up a vCluster

You can wake up a vCluster with two different vCluster CLI commands. 

As soon as the vCluster is woken up, vCluster will scale up any paused statefulset(s) or deployment(s) and the vCluster syncer will recreate the vCluster pods onto the host cluster.

### Wake Up the vCluster Directly

Wake up the vCluster with a vCluster CLI command:

```
vcluster wakeup my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```

### Connect to the vCluster to Wake Up

Connect to the vCluster with a vCluster CLI command, which will automatically wake up the vCluster:

```
vcluster connect my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace
```
