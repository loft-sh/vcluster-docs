## Versioned example

To specify a particular version of a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), append the version to the resource type, separated by a `/`, using the format `<resource>/<version>` in your configuration.

The specified version must exist in the host cluster when vCluster starts. This version becomes the storage version within the vCluster. When the storage version in the vCluster differs from the host cluster's storage version, vCluster automatically converts custom resources between the two versions.

For example, to use version `v1` of the `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io` CRD, specify:

<CodeBlock language="yaml" title={props.yamlTitle}>
  {`sync:
    ${props.scopeName ? `from` : 'to'}Host:
      customResources:
        certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1:
          enabled: true
          ${props.scopeName ? `scope: ${props.scopeName}` : ''}`}
</CodeBlock>

:::info Unique CRD versions
vCluster supports syncing only one version of a custom resource. If you specify multiple versions, the virtual cluster fails to start.

### Upgrade custom resources with explicit CRD API versions

vCluster supports syncing only one version of a CRD. If multiple versions are specified in the sync configuration, the virtual cluster fails to start.

vCluster modifies the CRD inside the virtual cluster during upgrades if it detects that a required version is missing. The following scenarios describe how vCluster handles CRD versions when you upgrade the virtual cluster or change the sync configuration.

#### Upgrade from no version to specified version

When upgrading from an unversioned CRD to a versioned one (`certificaterequests.cert-manager.io` → `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1`), vCluster checks the CRD's storage version. If the storage version is not `v1`, vCluster updates the CRD to include `v1` as a new version in addition to the current storage version.

#### Upgrade from one specified version to another specified version

When upgrading between versioned CRDs (`certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1` → `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v2`), the CRD is updated to include the new version `v2`, and the old version `v1` is kept as well.


#### Upgrade from a specified version to no version specified

When upgrading from a versioned CRD to an unversioned one (`certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1` → `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io`), the behavior depends on the host's storage version:

- If the CRD's storage version in the host is `v1`, nothing happens and the CRD in the virtual cluster remains as `certificaterequests.cert-manager.io/v1`.
- If the storage version is not `v1`, vCluster updates the CRD to include the storage version as a new version in addition to `v1`.
