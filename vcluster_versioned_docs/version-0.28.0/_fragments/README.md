# Fragments vs partials

Put fragments shared by multiple files in multiple sections here.

Note: _partials is for fragments generated by jobs

For fragments that are only shared between files in a single section, create a `_fragments` folder in the specific section.

Note: content ported from existing repos may have a section-level _partials folder that doesn't contain generated files.
