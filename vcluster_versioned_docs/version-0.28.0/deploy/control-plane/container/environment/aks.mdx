# Deploy vCluster on AKS
<!-- vale on -->

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying vCluster on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- `kubectl` installed: Kubernetes command-line tool for interacting with the cluster. See [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) for installation instructions.
- `vCluster CLI` <InstallCli />
- [Azure CLI (az)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
  :::note
  Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage AKS clusters in your Azure subscription.

:::tip Right subscription
Ensure you are using the correct Azure subscription by running `az account show`.
:::

Start by creating an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI. First, set up your environment variables:

<InterpolatedCodeBlock
  code={`export RESOURCE_GROUP=[[VAR:RESOURCE_GROUP:vcluster-demo-rg]]
export CLUSTER_NAME=[[VAR:CLUSTER_NAME:vcluster-demo]]
export LOCATION=[[VAR:LOCATION:eastus]]
export NODE_SIZE=[[VAR:NODE_SIZE:Standard_D4s_v3]]
export NODE_COUNT=[[VAR:NODE_COUNT:2]]`}
  language="bash"
/>

Create a resource group:

```bash title="Create resource group"
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
```

Create the AKS cluster:

```bash title="Create AKS cluster"
az aks create \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --location $LOCATION \
    --node-count $NODE_COUNT \
    --node-vm-size $NODE_SIZE \
    --generate-ssh-keys
```

This command creates an AKS cluster with managed identity enabled and Azure Monitor for containers.

### Configure kubectl

After the cluster is created, get credentials to access the cluster:

```bash title="Get cluster credentials"
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME
```

### Verify the host cluster creation

Verify the cluster by listing the nodes:

```bash title="List cluster nodes"
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see output similar to:
```
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
aks-nodepool1-34960941-vmss000000   Ready    <none>   67m   v1.29.9
aks-nodepool1-34960941-vmss000001   Ready    <none>   67m   v1.29.9
```

## Predeployment configuration options

Before deploying, it's recommended to review the set of configuration options that cannot be updated post deployment. These options require deploying a new vCluster instead of upgrading your vCluster with new options.

<ControlPlaneOptions />
<WorkerNodeOptions />

## Deploy vCluster on AKS

:::tip YAML configuration
If you're not sure which options to configure, you can update most settings later by upgrading your vCluster with an updated `vcluster.yaml`.
However, some settings — such as what type of worker nodes or the backing store — can only be set during the initial deployment and cannot be changed during an upgrade.
:::

<Deploy />

## Next steps

Now that you have vCluster running on AKS, consider exploring the [platform UI](/platform/install/quick-start-guide) to manage your virtual clusters.

## Cleanup

If you deployed the AKS cluster with this tutorial, and want to clean up the resources, run the
following command:

```bash title="Clean up resources"
az group delete --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --yes --no-wait
```
