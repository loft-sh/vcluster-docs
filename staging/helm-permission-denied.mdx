Facing helm permission denied error while creating the vCluster using vCluster-platform.

```
 error installing / upgrading vcluster: error executing /usr/local/bin/helm upgrade <vcluster-release-name> <vcluster-helm-chart-repo> --version <vcluster-version> --kubeconfig <path-to-kubeconfig> --namespace <namespace> --install --values <values-file>: Release <vcluster-release-name> does not exist. Installing it now.
    Error: mkdir /.cache: permission denied
     (exit status 1)
```

## Reason

The current user does not have permissions to create ​/.cache.

• `​XDG­_CACHE­_HOME`​ is a [base directory spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/) that Helm adopted and will use it as the cache home if it is set, but still allows configuring via helm specific environment variables. If `​XDG­_CACHE­_HOME`​ is unset, it defaults to `​$HOME/.cache`​ which is `​/home/loft/.cache`​ and the loft user already has permission there. In this example environment, this directory is set to `​/.cache​` and the loft user does not have the needed file permissions.

## Solution

• `​HELM­_CACHE­_HOME​` can be set independently if for some reason `​XDG­_CACHE­_HOME`​ is set to `/.cache` (or something else)

There are two options:

• If using UID 998 when running the platform, then set `​HELM­_CACHE­_HOME`​ (or `​XDG­_CACHE­_HOME`​) to the loft home dir location `​/home/loft/.cache`​ in helm values.
```
env:
  HELM­_CACHE­_HOME: /home/loft/.cache   # when using securityContext.runAsUser 998
```

• Or use UID 1000+, then set `​HELM­_CACHE­_HOME=/tmp/.cache`​ since all users have write permission to this location.

```
env:
  HELM­_CACHE­_HOME: /tmp/.cache       # when using securityContext.runAsUser 1001
```
