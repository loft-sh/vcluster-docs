 title: Resolving Ingress Update Conflicts When Using vCluster with Rancher
  sidebar_label: resolve vCluster with Rrancher ingress conflicts
  description: Resolving conflict in ingress when deploying Rancher in both vcluster and host cluster.
  ---
When deploying the Rancher agent in both vCluster and the host cluster, and using a single, shared ingress,  both agents will repeatedly update the ingress object, causing load on the DB and the API server.

## Symptoms
- Endless updates to ingress resources in the host cluster
- A rapid growth of the API server database. The DB may reach several GB
- Slowdown of the API server, causing simple commands like `kubectl get pods` to take several seconds

## Cause
This issue occurs due to a conflict between the rancher agent deployed in both vCluster and the host (outer) clusters. Both agents attempt to update annotations on the ingress, but they use different naming conventions, leading to a continuous update loop.

## Solution
This issue has been resolved in vCluster version 0.19.8. To fix the problem, upgrade your vCluster installation to this version or later.
If your API server is slow, compact your etcd database to reduce its size. This is specific to your Kubernetes distro and implementation and is outside the scope of this document.

## Steps to Upgrade using Helm
If you installed vCluster using Helm, Run the following command:
```
helm upgrade <<mycluster>> loft/vcluster --reuse-values --version 0.19.8
```
 Replace "mycluster" with the name of your vCluster release if different.

##Verification
After upgrading, monitor your cluster to ensure that:
- Ingress updates have stabilized
- The kine database size growth has slowed or stopped
- API server performance has returned to normal (The etcd database may need compacting before you see this)

## Additional Information
For more details about this fix and other changes in vCluster 0.19.8, refer to the [official release notes](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/releases/tag/v0.19.8).
