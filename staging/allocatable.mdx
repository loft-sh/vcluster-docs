## What is Allocatable?

'Allocatable' on a Kubernetes node is defined as the amount of compute resources that are available for pods. The scheduler does not over-subscribe requests beyond the 'Allocatable' value. 'CPU', 'memory', and 'ephemeral-storage' are supported.

## What is vCluster Virtual Scheduler?

By default, vCluster uses the host cluster schedule for making decisions on where pods should be scheduled. This saves on computing resources and means that a pod can be scheduled on any node.

using the host cluster scheduler has some limitations, as described in the [vCluster documentation]<https://www.vcluster.com/docs/vcluster/configure/vcluster-yaml/control-plane/other/advanced/virtual-scheduler>.

With Virtual Scheduler, vCluster will make pod allocation decisions, allowing taint and label nodes inside the virtual cluster without actually modifying the host cluster nodes.

## So what is the problem?

When using vCluster virtual scheduler feature, you will see a difference between the node allocatable value viewed on the host cluster and the node allocatable value seen in the vCluster context. 

 To understand why, consider the following scenario: Kubernetes cluster with three nodes, and vCluster is assigned to use only two of them. For simplicity, we'll only consider CPUs. (see image)

When describing the first node in the host Kubernetes cluster context, the output shows the node has 62.5 allocatable CPUs. This was calculated based on the 64 CPUs in the node, less kubeReserved and systemReserved values.  For more information on calculating allocatable value, see here.

When describing the same node in the vCluster context, the allocatable value will be 30.5 or lower.

Since allocation is done using the vCluster scheduler, and since the scheduler looks to the "Allocatable" value to know what not to over-subscribe beyond, the node capacity must reflect what is available for the vCluster to use and not the value in the host context.

The node details only show what vClsuter knows and has control over. Using the allocatable value from the host cluster would cause the scheduler in vCluster to over-subscribe the node. 

The logic for this change is implemented in the vCluster syncer. It regularly reads the node information in the host cluster and updates it in the vCluster.  This means that the value of "Allocatable" in vCluster will change over time as pods start and stop in the host context.
