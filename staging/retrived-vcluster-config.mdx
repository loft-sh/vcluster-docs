description: how to get vCluster config of a running vCluster

## Summary

You can deploy vCluster using Helm, CLI, ArgoCD, and many other ways. 
Sometimes, you'd want to see the already deployed vCluster configuration but don't have access to the config file used to deploy it.

## How-to steps

Use the vCluster CLI tool with the describe option like this:
```
vcluster describe <VCLUSTER NAME> --namespace <VCLUSTER NAMESPACE> -o yaml
```

If the vCluster CLI is not available, you can use kubectl command to see the config from the vCluster pod:
```
kubectl exec  --context=[HOST CONTEXT] -n [VCLUSTER NAMESPACE] [VCLUSTER POD NAME]
```
